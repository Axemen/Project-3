1,Johnnie Walker,,,40.00%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,97,225,Blended Scotch Whisky,UK,2.0,"What impresses me most is how this whisky evolves; it's incredibly complex. On the nose and palate, this is a thick, viscous, whisky with notes of sticky toffee, earthy oak, fig cake, roasted nuts, fallen fruit, pancake batter, black cherry, ripe peach, dark chocolate-covered espresso bean, polished leather, tobacco, a hint of wild game, and lingering, leafy damp kiln smoke. Flavors continue on the palate long after swallowing. This is what we all hope for (and dream of) in an older whisky!"
2,Black Bowmore,1964.0,42 year old,40.50%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,97,4500,Single Malt Scotch,UK,3.0,"There have been some legendary Bowmores from the mid-60s and this is every bit their equal. All of them share a remarkable aroma of tropical fruit, which here moves into hallucinatory intensity: guava, mango, peach, pineapple, grapefruit. There 's a very light touch of peat smoke, more a memory of Islay than the reality. Concentrated; even at low strength the palate is silky, heady, and haunting, and lasts forever in the dry glass. A legend is born. (Eight bottles only for the U.S.) Editor's Choice."
3,Bowmore,,46 year old,42.90%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,97,13500,Single Malt Scotch,UK,4.0,"With a name inspired by a 1926 Buster Keaton movie, only 1,698 bottles produced, and the news that one of the two batches is more than 30 years old, the clues were there that this blend was never going to be cheap. It isn't, but it's superb, rich in flavor that screams dusty old oak office, fresh polish, and Sunday church, with spices, oak dried fruits, squiggly raisins, and a surprising melting fruit-and-nut dairy chocolate back story."
4,Compass Box,,30 years old,53.40%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,96,325,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,UK,5.0,"Captivating, enticing, and wonderfully charming, this first blended malt from Chivas Regal contains selections of five Speyside malts: Strathisla, Longmorn, Tormore, Allt-a-Bhainne, and Braeval. Red apple, cherry, raspberry fudge, peach and mango fruit salad, dusting of cinnamon, and dry heather sprigs. In essence, it 's rich and satisfying, with dark vanilla, apricot, Bourneville-covered Brazil nuts, and tangerine, smoothed over by caramel and wood spices, maltiness, and gingersnap biscuits. Quite heavenly. Editor's Choice"
5,Chivas,,,40.00%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,96,160,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,UK,6.0,"Deep gold color. Surprisingly lively on the nose for its age. A complex array of fruit (tangerine, sultana, pink grapefruit, papaya, and the general overall citrus DNA that you 'll find in old Bowmores), with balancing notes of honey and vanilla. A hint of damp smoke and coconut. Just like with Black Bowmore, this is a texturally soothing whisky on the palate, which continues to evolve in waves -- first the sweet honey, coating vanilla, and lively fruit, then turning quite visceral, with juicy oak, damp earth, deep peat smoke, and charcoal, followed by another wave of fruit (this time, dried fruit), finishing off with subtle charred oak and roasted nuts. This whisky is better than White Bowmore, and it falls just short of Black Bowmore (which I rated 97), because it 's just a bit softer and less vibrant on the palate."
6,Gold Bowmore,1964.0,39 year old,42.40%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,96,6250,Single Malt Scotch,UK,7.0,"Definitely showing its age, but not in a bad way - the distillery character is still there. Solid foundation of thick, chewy toffee, old pot still rum, and fig cake. Fruity too, with notes of golden raisin and nectarine. Soft, seductive peat smoke, juicy oak, cinnamon, and brine round out the palate. Excellent balance! One of the finest Bowmore whiskies I 've ever tasted (and, at this price, will probably never taste again.) (Editor's Pick)"
7,Bowmore,,44 year old,44.80%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,96,11000,Single Malt Scotch,UK,8.0,"The Dalmore is one of a handful of whiskies that seem to be able to age in the cask for many decades and still improve. This one is incredibly viscous on the nose and palate (and very heavy on the tongue), with chewy toffee and old pot still rum. The classic Dalmore marmalade note shines throughout, along with vanilla cream, an array of dried spices (especially cinnamon and evergreen), juicy oak, forest bedding, rancio, old armagnac, polished leather, tobacco, maple syrup, dark chocolate, almond macaroon, and subtle espresso. Long, mouth-coating finish. The flavors evolve like waves lapping on the palate -- especially the interplay with the oak. I can 't drink this whisky slowly enough. A rare experience for the lucky few who can afford it. (Price is per 100ml.)"
8,The Dalmore,,50 year old,52.80%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,96,1500,Single Malt Scotch,UK,9.0,"A rich amber color and elegantly oxidized notes greet you. There are luscious old fruitsâpineapple, dried peach, apricotâand puffs of coal-like smokiness. In time, sweet spices (cumin especially) emerge. Superbly balanced. The palate, while fragile, still has real sweetness alongside a lick of treacle. It can take a drop of water, allowing richer, darker fruits to emerge. The finish is powerful, long, and resonant. Superb, not over-wooded, and a fair price for such a rarity.Â Â£1,995"
9,Glenfarclas,1954.0,,47.20%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,96,3360,Single Malt Scotch,UK,10.0,"It 's great that Glenlivet releases whiskies under the 'Cellar Collection' label. It really shows the true potential of Glenlivet. This bottling is classic ultra-matured Glenlivet, and rivals the 1959 vintage Cellar Collection as the best one ever. An incredibly complex whisky, with notes of vanilla, ripe barley, coconut, and caramel. All this is accentuated by glazed orange, hazelnut, and a potpourri of dried spices. Not the least bit tired for such an aged whisky. (Only 800 bottles for the U.S.)"
10,The Glenlivet,1969.0,,50.80%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,96,750,Single Malt Scotch,UK,11.0,"Classic sherry cask-aged Macallan. Antique amber with hints of ruby. Thickly textured, complex, and quite deep, with notes of toffee, ripe pit fruit, raisin, apple pie, dried spice (cinnamon, clove, ginger, and mint), and a wisp of smoke. An exceptional, multi-faceted Macallan!"
11,The Macallan,1976.0,29 year old,45.40%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,96,1500,Single Malt Scotch,UK,12.0,"A remarkable beauty from the Angus town of Montrose. The elegant nose shows a dram at peace with itself; golden syrup, hay bales, ground hazelnut, liquid honey, French baguette, High Mountain oolong, and rubbed spice blends. Refreshing palate of honey, toffee, citrus, honeycomb wax, and a profusion of sweet vanilla. Rich, sweet oak and deep pepper notes to finish. Truly a sublime and venerable grain. (106 bottles) Â£2,400"
12,The Last Drop,,,44.00%,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,96,3108,Grain Scotch Whisky,UK,13.0,"A marriage of three different single malts, aged in American and French oak. This whisky shows the advantage of marrying whiskies from more than one distillery (when properly done). Vibrant, with a complex array of fruit (orchard fruit, sultana), sweetness (light toffee, marzipan, honeyed malt), spice (creamy vanilla, mocha, warming pepper), smoke (tar, smoked olive, coal), and lesser notes of toasted almond and beach pebbles. More smoke and tar on the palate than the nose, yet always in balance. Well played! (Editor's Choice)"
13,Compass Box,,,48.90%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,95,105,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,UK,14.0,"As you 'd expect, solid peat is the first thing out of the glass, but this isn 't just a peat beast. Underneath are honey, dried fruit, and malt. The palate is all about balance, with honeyed malt, raisin, and oak spice all complementing smoky peat. A lush mouthfeel makes you forget it 's cask strength. A pure love note in a glass from Compass Box to Park Avenue Liquor.Â  (Park Avenue Liquor only)"
14,Compass Box,,,54.70%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,95,120,Blended Scotch Whisky,UK,15.0,"Formulated to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Johnnie Walker. This is a fabulous whisky for anyone who can spring for the bottle. It is deep, dark, and quite powerful with a hefty malt foundation and sweeter notes of toffee and vanilla combined with resinous oak, complex fruit (both bright citrus notes and darker pit fruits), crisp mint, tobacco, polished leather, and heavy peat smoke. A tour de force of a blended scotch-as big as many single malts reviewed here. 

"
15,Johnnie Walker,,,60.00%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,95,3500,Blended Scotch Whisky,UK,16.0,"An essay in balance on both the aroma and palate. Silky layers of delicate sweetness (honeyed vanilla, caramel, light toffee) permeate through clean, delicate fruit (citrus, peach, currant), and subtle, complex dried spice. Clean finish, with a hint of dark chocolate. A very versatile, very drinkable blend which suits most moods and occasions. Indeed, a benchmark blended scotch. 

"
16,Chivas,,18 year old,40.00%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,95,70,Blended Scotch Whisky,UK,17.0,"A spectacular citrus nose with incredible freshness; neroli oil, bergamot orange, an array of wood spices, baked apricot, dried strawberry, heather, lavender, honeysuckle, jasmine, and hyacinth. An intense array of citrus on the palateâthe strongest being mandarin, it is thick-textured yet agileâaccompanied by baked brioche, Ling heather honey, vanilla, and oak, with a hint of eucalyptus on the extraordinarily long finish. A masterclass in rare whisky blending."
17,Chivas,,,43.00%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,95,3500,Blended Scotch Whisky,UK,18.0,"Cask #3145 is the lighter in color, and the sweet notes that balance the smoke and seaweed are not as deeply caramelized as Cask #3542. I 'm tasting hints of shortbread and caramel, which show through the peat smoke, tobacco, toasted nuts, firm spice notes (cinnamon, clove, and mint), and lingering brine. Very complex. Price listed includes the entire Double Barrel 1974 Vintage set."
18,Ardbeg,1974.0,,49.90%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,95,20000,Single Malt Scotch,UK,19.0,"Part of the permanent Ardbeg range since 2008, Corryvreckan is created from a blend of standard Ardbeg and Ardbeg aged in virgin French Limousin oak casks. Smoky bacon and seaweed, plus dark berries, prickly spices, walnuts, lemon, and sweet peat on the nose. Sweet and savory on the palate, with more lively spice, woodsmoke, phenols, and licorice. The finish is lengthy, with peat, sea salt, pepper, and black coffee. Editors ' Choice"
19,Ardbeg,,,57.10%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,95,90,Single Malt Scotch,UK,20.0,"This expression was matured in a European oak oloroso sherry butt. Overtly sherried, with figs, sultanas, cinnamon, and old warm leather on the nose. Finally, fragrant, with milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight. The Turkish delight carries over to the palate, before the chocolate darkens to plain, with raisins, smoked ham, and cloves in the long finish. Remarkably, almost no tannic oak. Textbook stuff."
21,Bowmore,,50 year old,40.70%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,95,26650,Single Malt Scotch,UK,22.0,"Astonishingly fresh and clean for 30 years in oak, and with incredible depth. Slight oily texture. Appetizing brine, with honeyed vanilla, mustard seed, green olive, Seville orange, and lemon zest. Underlying smoke, damp peat, and seaweed. Put simply, Brora at its finest. 

"
22,Brora,,30 year old,55.70%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,95,400,Single Malt Scotch,UK,23.0,"Bottled in 2004, but just recently put in circulation here in the U.S. (Very strange.) It 's worth the wait. It 's fresh (even at 22 years old), appetizing, spicy, and briny. There 's a sweet foundation of vanilla wafer and caramel, with a slightly oily texture. White pepper, seaweed, mustard seed, lime, gherkin, and teasing gin botanicals add complexity. Spicy, salty finish. A vibrant, dynamic expression of the shuttered original Clynelish distillery. Quite stunning, actually. Find yourself a bottle before they 're gone!"
23,Lombard,1982.0,22 year old,50.00%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,95,200,Single Malt Scotch,UK,24.0,"This whisky has all the positive aspects of a very mature whisky (depth, complexity) without all the negative ones (excessive oak, one-dimensional). Very clean, but oily in texture, with honeyed vanilla, caramel, citrus (tangerine, orange, lemon), nectarine, olive brine, black pepper, ginger, cut grass, mustard seed, and just the hint of teasing smoke. Briny, spicy finish. Wonderful!"
24,Brora,2009.0,30 year old,53.20%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,95,400,Single Malt Scotch,UK,25.0,"Though Brora has acquired cult status, it has to be said that for a few years these Special Release Broras went through an off-putting butyric phase, which might well have put off newbies to this legendary closed site, who must have wondered what all the fuss was about.

One nose of the 2010 SR shows that these days have been consigned to the past. This is classy from the word go. Gold in color; the nose manages to be both overtly waxy - I 'm reminded of waxed paper - and fragrant. Behind that is coal smoke, rather than the heavy peatiness of earlier vintages (Brora 's peating levels varied in its last years). In other words, this is robust and powerful, with an evocative aroma that speaks of old sea chests, the seashore, and vellum. Hugely concentrated, with massed fruits - quince especially - following behind. This is amplified with a drop or two of water. 

The palate is unctuous and heavy. Tectonic plates move more quickly than this does in the mouth. When it does, the oily/waxy textures and flavors move slowly - camphor, peach, membrillo, hints of citrus, and toward the finish a growing brininess (akin to olives) and a hint of smoke. Elemental and one of the best Broras for years. [not available in the U.S.]Â£280"
25,Brora,2010.0,,54.30%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,95,455,Single Malt Scotch,UK,26.0,"Maturation of this 1978 distillate has taken place in European oak and refill American oak casks. Fresh and fruity on the early, herbal nose; a hint of wax, plus brine, developing walnut fudge, and an underlying wisp of smoke. Finally, wood resin. The palate is very fruity, with mixed spices, then plain chocolate, damp undergrowth, gentle peat smoke, and finally coal. Mildly medicinal. Ashy peat and aniseed linger in the long, slowly drying finish. Brora at its very best. (2,944 bottles) Editor's Choice"
26,Brora,,35 year old,49.90%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,95,750,Single Malt Scotch,UK,27.0,"It has been quite a while since we 've seen a new Glenfarclas here in the U.S. but, after tasting this whisky, it was worth the wait. Glenfarclas is a rich, stylish whisky that ages very well, and this 1968 vintage proves it. It is very deep and mature, with complex fruit (sultana, marmalade) layered by sweetness (honey, caramel, and toffee). All those years in oak contribute another dimension to the whisky, providing a dry, oaky spiciness, polished leather, and a hint of tobacco-especially on the finish. Never does the whisky taste tired or excessively woody. It expresses all that is good about an older whisky, without any of the down side. I 'm told that most of the 1,400 bottles imported to the U.S. went to the Chicago area. It 's worth taking the extra time to track down a bottle."
27,Glenfarclas,1968.0,,43.00%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,95,200,Single Malt Scotch,UK,28.0,"Glenfarclas has a proven track record for aging very well. I 've enjoyed some amazing 25 and 30 year old expressions, in addition to some older vintage offerings. Does this new 40 year old follow suit? Absolutely! It 's complex and well-rounded, with great depth and no excessive oak. Lush, candied citrus (especially orange), old pot still rum, maple syrup, fig, roasted nuts, and polished leather, with hints of mocha, candied ginger, and tobacco. A bit oily in texture (which I find soothing) with good tannic grip on the finish. A classic, well-matured Glenfarclas - and a very good value for its age. (Editor's Choice)"
28,Glenfarclas,,40 year old,46.00%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,95,460,Single Malt Scotch,UK,29.0,"An excellent example of an ultra-mature, sherried whisky done the right way. Much darker and more decadent than the other two releases here. Silky texture. Rummy, jammy fruit, toasted walnut, leather, spice (cinnamon, clove), tobacco, and dark chocolate, with a foundation of juicy oak. Tasting this whisky, you know it 's old, but you also know it 's very good."
29,Glenglassaugh,,40 year old,44.60%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,95,2525,Single Malt Scotch,UK,30.0,"A marriage of three casks, one of them an ex-sherry butt. The sherry is certainly evident, and this is more sherried than many of the Cellar Collection whiskies to date. Opulent and seductive, with prominent fruit (glazed spiced oranges, ripe peach, and hints of pineapple and coconut), caramel-coated nuts, and vanilla custard. A peppering of ginger and cinnamon throughout. Coating, soothing finish. Polished and seamless, with no trace of excessive oak. One of the richest -- and finest -- Cellar Collections to date. Anyone willing and able to cough up the bucks for this whisky will be richly rewarded. (Only 240 bottles available in the U.S., beginning June 2010.)"
30,The Glenlivet,1973.0,,49.00%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,95,1250,Single Malt Scotch,UK,31.0,"Dark and decadent. Notes of old pot still rum, roasted nuts, chocolate fudge, burnished leather, Dundee cake, tobacco, and a hint of damp peat. When I drink this, I feel like I 'm sitting in the study of a stately Scottish mansion contemplating a fine, aged Cuban cigar. Royalty in a glass. (Bottled for Binny 's Beverage Depot)

31,Highland Park,1973.0,8 year old,54.40%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,95,280,Single Malt Scotch,UK,32.0,"The nose of this veteran is hugely enticing; rich, with old leather, soft spices, sultanas, figs, polished oak, and dunnage warehouses. Tangy orange develops in time. The orange carries over onto the palateâamazingly vibrant and youthful fruitinessâfollowed by soft toffee, woodsmoke, and a sprinkling of dusty oak. The finish is extraordinarily long, with licorice and fruit-laden old oak. A true classic! (77 bottles in U.S.)"
32,Highland Park,,50 year old,42.50%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,95,15000,Single Malt Scotch,UK,33.0,"The flavors evolve on the nose and palate, with peat kiln smoke, fresh asphalt, damp earth warehouses, morning-after campfire ash, and old boat dock contrasting nicely with toffee apple, crÃ¨me caramel, delicate raspberry preserve, and dried citrus. Long, smoky, spicy, briny, seaweed, dirty martini-tinged finish. This whisky comes from a combination of both sherry and bourbon casks, and the marriage works. I also like that it retains some of its youthful brashness, while showing the depth that maturity affords a whisky. A delicious, well-balanced, old-fashioned Laphroaig.(Reviewing this whisky gave me an excuse to open a ""fresh"" bottle of its predecessor, the 30 year old, and here are my thoughts. The 30 year old is softer, mellower, drier, and more debonair. The 25 year old is bolder, more youthful, more dynamic, richer, and sweeter - bottling at cask strength really helps here. Both whiskies are very nice, but quite different in personality.)"

These Springers from the '60s are getting rarer and quite expensive. This is a great example of why they are so coveted -- clean and well matured, with no sign of excessive oak. Elegant sherried fruit dovetails nicely with polished oak and a steady stream of dried spices. Look for citrus, nectarine, red licorice, coconut oil, ripe banana, and vanilla custard with warming cinnamon and brine. Warm, spicy finish. Very polished!"

They've added some Laphroaig into the mix of Caol Ila and Ardmore. This whisky demonstrates the layered complexity that can be achieved by marrying whisky from different distilleries and different regions. I particularly enjoy the rich maltiness and oily texture that provide firm bedding and flavor contrast to the classic Islay notes: tar, boat docks, brine, smoked olive, seaweed, and kiln ash. More subtle cracked peppercorn, mustard seed, and citrus fruit add complexity. Long, warming finish. Amazing how a small change in composition can significantly benefit the overall flavor profile of a whisky."

The supple grain sustains indulgent, characterful malts creating a weighty, smooth mouthfeel.

Still quite vibrant and invigorating for such maturity. The classic Balvenie honey note is there, but more reserved, along with graham cracker, vanilla wafer, citrus peel, raspberry (red and black), nectarine, and polished oak. Long, spicy finish.

The oak is always present, but not dominant. The whisky really evolves on the palate, just like the Black Bowmore releases. This emphasis here is on fruit, bright fruit: peach, tangerine, mango, ripe melon, and pineapple. There 's a soft, gentle side to the whisky, too, enhanced by sweeter notes of pancake syrup, orange creamsicle, and white chocolate. Heavy oak notes emerge, along with teasing, earthy smoke, to give the whisky depth and bottom notes. The smoke and oak linger long on the finish. Very contemplative. In short, an outstanding whisky, but not quite reaching the excellence of Black Bowmore.

This new 28 year old expression, besides being two years younger, is also slightly less sherried. In this instance, I feel that both have enhanced the whisky. Trimming back on the sherry and oak allows the whisky 's trademark orange marmalade, complex spice, and briny freshness to shine through. This one is lively, dynamic, evolving, well-balanced, and always entertaining. The best Dalmore Stillman 's Dram in years."

It is wonderfully integrated, with incredible depth and maturity without being tired-and it expresses a soothing quality that doesn 't quit. It is stunning throughout and more polished and rounded than the 1968 Vintage released a while back, which, while enjoyable, was a tad sappy and a bit too oaky at times. This whisky is easily one of the 10 best new whiskies for 2005, and worth every penny. Get a bottle while you can.

Quite deep on the nose and viscous (almost sappy) on the palate, with gobs of juicy oak and old oak (its age is obvious but not imposing), dark raisin, black raspberry, orange marmalade, roasted nuts, and freshly roasted coffee beans. All of this is peppered with cinnamon, ginger, and charcoal. Polished leather on the finish. I like that it 's sherried, and the sherry is kept in balance.

There's certainly plenty of sherry influence in this whisky and it is complementary. (About 2/3 of the whisky was aged on sherry casks, and a lot of these casks were second fill.) The whisky enjoys a delicious foundation of toffee, fruit (lemon, plum, blueberries) and dark chocolate. It continues to develop and evolve on the palate, with emerging notes of heather, nougat, lavender, delicate peat and complex dried spice (especially cinnamon and nutmeg) to balance the sweeter notes. The extra alcohol is also a bonus, providing a drying balance to the whisky's sweetness. Whiskies like this one remind me why I fell in love with whisky in the first place."

Huge and complex, in other words. The palate starts with a fug of smoke being belched at you (non-peat freaks look away, now) then distinct saltiness enlivens the tongue before everything plunges down; intense sweetness takes charge for a moment before it shifts into charred creosoted timbers. This begs for some water, and when it 's added, out comes sandalwood and peat smoke and tar and an orris root-like character - it 's not often I get gin-like notes on Lagavulin, but it 's here - which rolls over you as you roll over and succumb to its power.

Laphroaig 's owners are intent on ensuring a big peaty engine for any new release, but this is a monster by anyone 's standards. It 's essentially Quarter Cask finished in oloroso sherry casks, so in addition to the intense charcoal smoke attack there are rich fruity notes; blackcurrant and berries. It 's an evening barbecue whisky. Grill that fish until it 's blackened and crispy, drizzle on lemon, and as the smoke rears up in protest, sip this.

Antique amber/chestnut color. Full sherry impact, but never cloying -- the higher alcohol level and grain whisky cut through the sherry and add balance and drinkability. This is a fruity-confection delight, with raisin chutney, fig cake, orange almond scone, and chocolate-covered cherry.

Notes of squeaky-clean fruit (tangerine, peach, nectarine, kiwi) in light syrup. Vibrant spice (cinnamon, white pepper, anise), creamy vanilla, and almond evolve on the palate, leading to a gentle finish. Surprisingly lively for a whisky more than 30 years old. When I think of great Glenrothes vintages, I go back to the 1972 vintage for comparison. Both are comparable in quality, with the 1972 vintage showing darker sugars, more weight, and more roasted nuts.

Dry and spicy on the finish, but never austere. A delicious, contemplative 40 year old Highland Park that has aged gracefully.



This is a permanent addition to the range. Out of curiosity, I tasted it next to the other great Highland Parks (the 30 year old and several very good single cask bottlings over 30 years old).

The peat smoke is restrained on the nose, but is more assertive on the palate, and it really kicks in on the finish, which is briny, smoky, appetizing, and long.

For me, this is up there with last year 's bottling, which itself ushered in a return to high standards after a slight dropping-off in expressiveness.

This is different, however. Yes, the color is as pale as ever - has anyone ever tasted an over-oaked Port Ellen? - and yes, the nose initially shows all of the distillery 's austere notes: think of a wet fish counter and the sensation of the sea rather than overt 'fishiness, ' while there 's also a chilled cucumber note. The difference is the sweetness, which is more to the fore, and also, it would seem, a slight dropping-off in massive smokiness. Here the peat is integrated into the whole.

The palate has a numb spot right on the front, then wasabi-like heat coupled with olive oil. Soon the sea rolls in and it stands there like some creature from the Black Lagoon covered with balls of tar, draped in wet seaweed, encrusted with barnacles and clams - and clutching a kipper. But don 't forget the sweetness that spreads across the tongue and slowly drifts into fresh spice and antiseptic. Complexâ¦and there 's a scant 3,000 bottled for the globe.

Signature is Dewar 's introduction into the ultra-premium blended scotch category. Like Johnnie Walker Blue, Signature bears no age statement, but I 'm told that a 27 year old Aberfeldy is the heart of the blend. The first release consists only of 1,000 individually numbered bottles, and they 're only available in New York City. I 'm always a little skeptical of very expensive blends that come in fancy packages. There are some very good, reasonably priced blends in the 10-20 year old range, and the expensive ones are often only marginally better, if that. But I like this whisky a whole lot better than the standard Dewar 's White Label, and it is also superior to Dewar 's 12 year old-a whisky which I find to be quite enjoyable. While maintaining the Dewar 's profile-nicely balanced-this whisky offers greater depth, maturity, and complexity without being too woody-a creamy, malty foundation makes sure of that. The whisky expresses a rich, honeyed maltiness which combines nicely with notes of golden raisins, vanilla, caramel, and crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, with just a hint of spicy oak notes for complexity. Signature is a different style when compared to Johnnie Walker Blue-it 's more elegant and bashful-but, like Blue, I put Signature on my short list of the finest blends on the market.

This bottling is light, soft, sweet, and juicy. Orange flavors and peat team up to steer a middle way for what is a delicious and highly more-ish malt. Its only flaw is in the finish, which dies away too quickly for this palate. Perhaps a slightly higher strength would have improved it.

Aromas of dried citrus, lemongrass, and ginger with background honeyed vanilla, dried herb, bouquet of roses, and a wisp of smoke. Very long and evolving on the palate, going from sweet to dry: vanilla custard, crÃ¨me brulee, white chocolate, candied citrus, juicy oak, polished leather, dried tobacco, and then resinous oak, with teasing dry roasted nuts and hint of peat bog throughout. Long dry, resinous finish. Remarkably well-maintained for its age. I can tell that it 's an old whisky, but it shows good complexity. It 's not tired and excessively oaked.

When compared to the 30 year old and 40 year old expressions, it 's actually more vibrant and youthful than the 40 sample I have. Yet it doesn 't have the deft balance and roundness which I consider a hallmark of the 30. Bottom line here: Anyone who can afford this whisky and actually drinks it will not be disappointed. It 's really nice. But for us regular folk, try to pick up a 30 year old Glenfiddich if you can find one and you won 't go wrong with the whisky - or the price (relatively speaking, that is)."

In this offering, the palate-coating, sticky caramel, syrupy maltiness of the whisky is rescued by firm, bold dry oak spice and lush fruit. Delicious toffee and roasted nuts longer on the finish. The 30 years in oak gives this whisky great depth, and bottling the whisky at natural cask strength ensures that the whisky is not cut off at the knees. A soothing post-prandial affair.

It 's soft, rounded, and still holds up nicely for a 44 year old whisky. If you like old, sherried Speysiders that aren 't overly oaked or sherried, you 'll like this one. If only it was bottled at 43% or 46% (or at natural cask strength, if it was less than 43%). It would give the whisky a little more backbone, and I might have bumped my rating up to the mid-90s.

Layers of sweetness (caramel in particular, but also honey and toffee) dovetail beautifully with an array of lush fruit (orange, apricot, golden raisin, fruit gumdrops). All this is underpinned by subtle dried spice (cinnamon, cool mint, nutmeg) and teasing oak resin on the finish. What 's most impressive here isn 't the laundry list of flavors (although they certainly are there), but rather the balance. This, and its lovely depth, with no signs of lethargy. Impressive!

Number 15 in the 2018 Top 20Â

Layered fruit (bright orchard fruit, honeyed melon, kiwi, pineapple), polished oak, and hay, subtly spiced with vanilla bean, milk chocolate, evergreen, and cotton candy. Bottled at peak maturity. Very more-ish, too! (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)"

The fragrance of an early morning visit to a florist, zesty orange notes, honey, peach pits, a hint of salt, and the faintest trace of smoke. It 's silky smooth, glistening with honey, a firm edge of orange, vanilla tablet, barley sugar, powdered ginger, all elevated by the grains supporting the Scapa. A smooth, feather-light finish of sparkling light spices and creaminess. A joy to behold."
425,Duncan Taylor,,23 year old,46.30%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,91,200,Single Malt Scotch,UK,427.0,"You really don 't see many of these. Pear drops, stewed apple, strawberry jam, fragrant rhubarb stems, and vanilla pods. Neat, there 's a tacky sweetness of hard candy, with bitter skins of damson and green plum, sloes, and custard creams. Counteract this with water to bring out acetone, cake mix, and sweet bourbon notes of vanilla and creamed coconut. Then it is triumphant. Dry oak and dark vanilla complete one of the longest finishes I 've savored this year. (111 bottles)Â Â£420"
426,Ballantine,,17 year old,43.00%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,91,80,Blended Scotch Whisky,UK,428.0,"A larger and mightier beast overall, with menthol, mint Life Savers, raisins, chocolate wafer bars, and thick gray smoke lifting off smoldering peat. The experience is mouth drawing and full bodied at this strength, with sweet orange, milk chocolate, clove, and nutmeg, the roof of the palate cloaked in a night sky of celestial peppery spices. Take it easy with water, but use it to unshackle the soaring citrus notes. (1,100 bottles for the U.S.)"
427,The Sovereign,,50 year old,49.20%,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,91,657,Single Grain Whisky,UK,429.0,"There is a beautiful interplay between the lemon and sharp lime set against the bracing coastal nature of this dram. Gentle vanilla, honey, lemon zest, and gooseberry compote waft from the glass. Vanilla frosting, coconut macaroon bars, malt drinks, peach, lemon, and an undercurrent of pepper. Creamy chocolate once the spice subsides, it ends with a fantastically chewy mouthfeel. Nuts, pepper, and cocoa make for a mouth-coating finish."
428,Big Peat,,26 year old,51.80%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,91,300,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,UK,430.0,"This dark, chestnut liquid exudes wafts of rose hip, dense fruitcake, sliced fig, cherry, oak, Brazil nut, and earthy, fragrant damp moss within the rich sherry complexity. A voluptuous, palate-saturating whisky, with burnt orange, ginger spices, star anise, dried fig, and ripe purple plums, concluding with chocolate truffles. It 's a rollicking good blend, dripping with sherry notes, and leaves a deep glow far back in the palate. You 're going to love it. (1,428 bottles)Â Â£120"
429,That Boutique-y Whisky Company,,23 year old,47.40%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,91,111,Single Malt Scotch,UK,431.0,"A pedigree blend gracing your glass with aromas of sultana, prune, glacÃ© cherry, toffee, nutmeg, dense dark fruits, sweet toffee, and cozy Christmas spices. This well-paced, silky blend canters through red apple, cherry, pomegranate, pressed date bars, Brazil nut, nutmeg, and pepper. Cinnamon, black pepper, and apple peel make for a harmonious finish. A suitably glamorous libation for spectators of the sport of kings. Â£110"
430,That Boutique-y Whisky Company,,35 year old,46.50%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,91,150,Blended Scotch Whisky,UK,432.0,"Deep amber. Generous sweet sherried nose; very ripe, with dried orchard fruits, chestnut puree, and indeed chestnut honey, then a little touch of meat and a pungency akin to Guyanan pot still rum. Sumptuous. As it opens there 's a fluxing mix of sticky toffee, game, pomegranate, and dried red fruits. The palate is deeply savory, with floor polish and cooked plums, finishing with fragrant pepper. The cask has a huge say in things, but the spirit copes. Excellent.Â Â£191"
431,Royal Salute,,21 year old,40.00%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,91,145,Blended Scotch Whisky,UK,433.0,"Here we see a significant step-change from the progression of 13 to 19 (see below). Now, there is added spice, ripe fresh cooked and dried fruits, and a touch of the peat smoke that used to be lightly added. With water, a mix of maple syrup and waxiness comes through. Complex and deep. The palate remains thick and silky, with melted white chocolate before lilies make an appearance alongside baked pineapple. Structured, layered, long, and elegant.Â Â£337"
432,Douglas Laing,,22 year old,57.10%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,91,280,Single Malt Scotch,UK,434.0,"Part of the Rare Vintage range, this was matured in first-fill sherry butts. Spicy sultanas and figs on the nose, plus a menthol note. Fragrant old hessian. The palate is initially malty-sweet, with sherried Christmas cake notes, then plain chocolate and raisins emerge. The finish is long, spicy, and drying in a leisurely manner, with the expected level of tannins for a whisky of this vintage.Â£620"
433,Craigellachie,,23 year old,46.00%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,91,536,Single Malt Scotch,UK,435.0,"Rather luxurious aromas of orange peel, walnut, stewed fruits, fleshy plum, peach pit, sherry fruit, gentle oak, and wood spices. Spiced marmalade, dark Seville orange, plum, vanilla, and plump raisin; this lays down a rich blanket of flavor, though it 's slit open by a piercing blade of spice. I like the subtlety of the sherry influence and the mouth-coating finish of orange peel, ginger, and spice."
434,Gordon & MacPhail,,,43.00%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,91,763,Single Malt Scotch,UK,436.0,"Sweet and sherried, with plenty of sugar and toffee, moving into plums and thick chestnut honey. Give it time, however, and a haunting note of dried mango and guava emerges, followed by amontillado-style nuttiness and then beeswax polish. All in all, just what you want from a gently-aged BenRiach. The palate may seem initially grippy, but there 's such a massing of fruits that it copes well. Keep neat for maximum impact. Superb.

435,Grand Macnish,,15 year old,43.00%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,91,55,Blended Scotch Whisky,UK,437.0,"There should be few qualms about snapping up this aged Highland gem given the blender 's prowess and the generous pricing. Ripe stone fruit, straw, sweet oak, and ground almond on the nose. For its advancing years, it 's quite a ride at full strength; thick, glossy, and mouth-coating with tangy sweet oranges, fudge, and candied citrus. Best sipped neat, it ebbs away with bright orange fruit and buzzy spices. (1,080 bottles) Â£200"
436,Adelphi,1977.0,34 year old,48.80%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,91,283,Single Malt Scotch,UK,438.0,"Coconut macaroon, baked sweet pastries, peach purÃ©e, sanded oak, Starburst chews, pear, caramel shortbread, strands of orange zest, and crushed allspice and coriander seeds. Far from timorous, this grown-up Highlander has the heart of a lion, with flavors of cooked apple, dark molasses, vanilla pod, lots of oak tannin, pepper, and coriander seed, with a finish of dark sugars and peppery heat. Quite an animal. (828 bottles for the U.S.)"
437,Timorous Beastie,,40 year old,54.70%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,91,246,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,UK,439.0,"Powerful and rich to begin with. Some raisin syrup backed with clean, apple-like acidity adding some freshness. This swells into a deep but refined musky apple/pear note with some black fruits behind. Highly complex, but full of distillery character. Water brings out a note like freshly-applied varnish. The palate is smooth, gentle, and deep. A classic mature Linkwood with all of the distillery character on show in perfect alliance with the cask."
438,Timorous Beastie,,24 year old,46.80%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,91,200,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,UK,440.0,"A welcome return for Hart Brothers. This Glen Grant is light, clean, and penetrating, with lots of gooseberry, melon, basil, and cut grass. This turns into an intriguing note of concentrated fruits; think yellow wine gums and fresh William pear. The palate has classic Glen Grant purity, with a hint of tropical fruits. Water adds another graceful layer on top, making the effect more like a rose gardenâ¦one which you keep returning to. Excellent.Â Â£66"
439,Cadenhead,,,51.10%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,91,300,Single Malt Scotch,UK,441.0,"This 2016 release in its ceramic flagon entices you with lemon, soft fruits, honey, digestive biscuits, and taffy candy. It 's dense and weighty; oozing with flavors of barley sugar, caramel, sweet oak, and some mature orange peel characteristics underpinned with ginger and pepper. Profoundly long, sweet finish pricked with bitter orange and spice. One of those great drams that you can happily imbibe at cask strength without dilution. (2,000 bottles)"
440,Hart Brothers,,22 year old,51.10%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,91,103,Single Malt Scotch,UK,442.0,"Distilled from Scottish barley, this is the first permanent age-statement Port Charlotte bottling. First and second-fill American oak and French wine casks were used for aging. Rock pools, lemon juice, caramel, but little overt peat on the nose. The palate boasts big orchard fruit notes, smoky coconut, and brine. Again, the peat is quite muted. Long and spicy in the drying, peaty finish."

The new make spirit initially spends 6 to 9 months in 24 to 100-liter Hudson Baby Bourbon casks. It 's then transferred to virgin oak, first-fill, and refill American oak casks for several years. The ultimate vatting is non-chill filtered. A sweet, smoky nose with almonds and walnuts leads into a palate featuring citrus fruit, spicy peat, and cereal notes, with cocoa and soft oak in the finish. (UK and Nordic availability) Â£55"

444,Jura,,,51.00%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,91,158,Single Malt Scotch,UK,446.0,"Inhale deeply and this bestows a sense of serenity; morning dew on clipped lawns strewn with spent fireworks and strands of honey mingled with subtle, elegant smoke. Blender Maureen Robinson 's light, well-balanced creation ushers in gentle honey and growing sweetness, before billowing puffs of smoke grow dominant. Charred peaks of a lemon meringue pie, iced coffee, and milk chocolate follow, leaving a catch of smoke in the aftertaste. Quite a charmer."
445,anCnoc,,35 year old,41.00%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,91,615,Single Malt Scotch,UK,447.0,"Sweet caramel on the boundary of maple syrup flavors, with aging tobacco leaf, walnuts, malted barley, charcoal sticks, and snuffed candle wicks, all cushioned by soft oak. An initial impression of a lighter character, though it 's bursting with juicy toffee, butterscotch sauce, wood spices, and dried banana. The spices vibrate gently around the gums on the dry finish of this high-malt content blend, leaving nutty residual flavors."
446,Buchanan,,,40.00%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,91,169,Blended Scotch Whisky,UK,448.0,"The salty coastal twang meets the sherry head on, revealing mandarin, gingerbread, glazed ham, clove, seashells, and driftwood bonfires built on pebble beaches. Smoke comes to dominate the sherry. Orange oils precede a delayed ignition of the spices. More honeyed sweetness comes through, while a smothering layer of peat rises up. Warm spicy finish, until a thick curtain of smoke closes it down. But hey, this rocks."
447,Alexander Murray & Co.,,18 year old,40.00%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,91,65,Blended Scotch Whisky,UK,449.0,"After 12 years of waiting, Francis Cuthbert has finally released the first bottling of his Daftmill Lowland single malt. The nose is soft and floral, with peaches, walnuts, coconut, warm caramel, and milk chocolate. The palate features cereal, almonds, nougat, and subtle citrus fruits. Drying in the relatively long finish, with subtle oak. Well worth the wait! (629 bottles) Â£210"
448,Rock Oyster,,,46.80%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,91,60,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,UK,450.0,"Chocolate orange, a sizzle of bacon fat, and dry peat. While this feels less potent than Samaroli 's other Islay offerings, it fits the mood perfectly for a nightcap. The taste buds detect orange, honey, chocolate praline, hazelnut, Oreos, a hint of cocoa, and an underbelly of peat smoke that carries into the finish. A wonderfully rich, smooth digestif that will transport you back to Islay in your dreams."

Sweet and zingy on the palate, with lemon oil, guava candy, blueberry, strawberry, gentle spice, milk chocolate, and walnuts. More spice on the finish, with polished oak and dried fruit. Well constructed, supple, and easy to enjoy. (Total Wine & More)"

This is a mix of malts from different distilleries and it has the company's distinctive DNA all over it, combining siege cannon-strength peated malt with rich, fruity, sherried whisky. It's clumsier than the wonderful Flaming Heart but in the same ballpark, and I have to declare an interest - I adore this combination when it's delivered right. Â£180"
452,Glen Fohdry,,12 year old,47.10%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,91,38,Single Malt Scotch,UK,454.0,"The smoking wicks of church candles, smoked meat, coastal notes, cumin, coriander seed, and herbal elements. A sophisticated palate of unsweetened fruit. Peaches, citrus, and pineapple, with a waxy presence building later on, settles to a dry finish of herbs and beeswax. We can easily overlook the narcissism of making tributes to your own past bottlings as John Glaser turns whisky resurrectionist in homage to Eleuthera. Layered, complex, thought provoking, and finely tuned for the connoisseur."
453,Compass Box,,,53.70%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,90,287,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,UK,455.0,"Compared to Asyla, this has noticeable added richness, fruit, and spice. The nose brings apple danish, creamy custard, honey, citrus peel, and the fragrance of lightly toasted spices. Against a core of rich, tangy fruits, a spicy partnership of pepper and clove manifests under the tongue, stealthily curls around the sides, and storms the palate. The mouth-coating finish drips with mandarin and cooked apple pierced by clove."
454,Compass Box,,,46.00%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,90,120,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,UK,456.0,"A blend of four single malts for the latest incarnation, this has poached pear, sweet green apple, melon skins, light spices, barley sugar, and yet some crunchy barley notes too. Sweet vanilla fattens out to orange, peppercorn, honey, and barley sugar, with apple and herbal greenery appearing at the end. Hold for at least 30 seconds, then there 's spice at the swallow, and a waxy, mouth-coating finish of smooth-pulped fruits. (14,894 bottles)"
455,Compass Box,,,43.00%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,90,59,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,UK,457.0,"A special bottling in recognition of Chicago's outstanding alternative rock venue Delilah's, and like that venue this is full of character, color, grit, and determination. It's sweet but never cloying, soft and honeyed but gutsy, and there are peppermint, licorice, and fresh hay notes in the mix, too. It's spent time in bourbon wood and that shows. A departure for Compass Box, but a healthy one."
456,Compass Box,,,46.00%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,90,150,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,UK,458.0,"A fantastically earthy whisky bristling with real, grubby peat: more blazing, bothy peat fire than coastal campfire. Fleeting elements of fudge and smoldering, mellow cigar stubs. A smooth, creamy blend with lemon curd, vanilla sponge, mint, smoked prosciutto, and a dollop of malt. There 's wonderfully smoky, singeing heat at the back of the palate, though it feels like the Islay peat has been pegged back for the 2015 batch. A succulent and smoky finish to warm the soul."
457,Compass Box,,,40.00%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,90,65,Blended Scotch Whisky,UK,459.0,"Dried heather, peppercorn, salt crystals, green fruits, dried fennel, aniseed, dry leaves, and floral top notes produce a lip-smacking bouquet like a chilled manzanilla. The palate has vanilla tablet sweetness like the previous Delilah 's release, though this is bottled at higher strength, with flavors of dried fruits: peach, apricot, and mandarin. (8,520 bottles)"
458,Compass Box,,,46.00%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,90,60,Blended Scotch Whisky,UK,460.0,"An older, more exotic expression of Hedonism, consisting of 42 year old Invergordon and 29 year old Cameron Bridge grain whiskies. Straw gold color. This is richer and cleaner than most other grain whisky offerings, which are often too thin and overweight with dry oak. Like many older grain whiskies, creamy vanilla, coconut custard, and a variety of tropical fruits abound. Additional notes of toasted marshmallow, caramelized apricot, golden raisin, and a gentle dried spice finish add complexity. Surely one of the better examples of this rather eccentric category.

Earthy peat smoke with medicinal characteristics of lanolin and antiseptic, a salty tang balanced with creamy vanilla, strands of citrus, and touches of menthol and aniseed. Smooth as a thief in the night; mouth-coating toffee, growing smoky notes, and peppered mackerel push back the waxy, citrus elements. Now the fire is alive; the sweetness gets out while it can.

Among others, this comprises Talisker, Linkwood, Cragganmore, and Caol Ila malts. Fruit follows smoke, with vanilla, pastry desserts, and peppercorn spices, becoming creamier with shredded peel, apple cobbler, and a warming finish of orange peel and forward spices."

If you've got a whisky maker as good as Jim Beveridge, then why not? This picks up from the regular JW Black and its signature Caol Ila smoke and peat heart and then adds to it, doing exactly what it says on the tin. But the clever part of this is upping the apple, orange, and fruit content too. Great."

Orange grove before harvest, a rounded candied peel note, plenty of sweet grain, and creamy vanilla, all backed by gentle spice. Luscious and chewy caramel, taffy candy, lavishly rich orange, and glowing spice notes wrap around the tongue. It 's incredible how they can make this tasty blend of five whiskies look so devastatingly easy (when it 's not). Value Pick"

Toasted oak, chocolate praline, sweet runny caramel, coffee, and a catch of smoke dissipate to leave the smooth flavor of creamy toffee penny candy.

Malts from five of Pernod Ricard 's Speyside distilleries (Strathisla, Longmorn, Tormore, Allt-a-Bhainne, and Braeval) were used to create intricate and elaborate flavors. Even more enchanting than the story are the aromas of fresh red apple, cherry, peach, and mango, mingled with cinnamon and dry heather. This luxurious whisky delivers dark vanilla, soft fruits, chocolate-dipped Brazil nuts, and is cloaked in sumptuous layers of caramel, wood spices, and gingersnaps. Outstanding.

Great maturity with masses of orchard fruits and a hint of passion fruit as well. The oak is rounded and supple while with water a banana note is released. Thick and chewy, with more grip than suggested on the nose and a little nut on the finish. Great blending."
466,Chivas,,,40.00%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,90,160,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,UK,468.0,"The divine stone fruit aromas are the key to unlocking the nose on this one: apricot, honey, vanilla icing, malt bins, Quaker Oats Squares, and lofty floral top notes. Sweet mandarin, brown sugar, vanilla fudge, strands of finely shredded peel, and more spice than the 12 year old can muster. The sweet vanilla aftertaste is softer and more elegant than the younger expressions."

Lemon meringue pie, tangerine zest, lime, and pineapple form the whisky 's substance, which is augmented by a time-delayed progression through caramel, ground almond, espresso, and chocolate brownie. Smoke hangs like a specter at the feast."

Here 's what I 'm picking up, in somewhat descending order in taste profile: leafy smoke, coal tar, mocha fudge with dark chocolate chips, smoked olive, peppered seaweed salad, fruit (lemon, lime), genever, brine-tinged grass, and (with some coaxing) floral notes (violet?). Compared to last year 's debut release of Supernova, this one is certainly comparable, but I feel it 's a tad richer, with more leafy smoke and ripe barley. It also seems a bit more polished, less aggressive. I like it a little more than its predecessor (rated 89)."

It 's made up of a mÃ©lange of different casks: American oak, refill, French oakâ¦and others. Intense, marine, with pineapple, wet moss, tar, cracked black pepper, and a nuttiness. The palate is oily, sweet, with smoked cream, balanced by a very pure acidity, then soot and char. Will the fact that it isn 't an extreme Ardbeg satisfy everyone? Probably not. Is it a bloody good session drink? Damn right it is. (200th anniversary bottling)"

Well-mannered peat, brine, orange peel, vanilla, and black pepper on the palate. The finish is long, smoky, and peppery."
473,Ardbeg,,,47.40%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,90,100,Single Malt Scotch,UK,475.0,"The oldest Ardmore I have tasted. Smartly bottled at cask strength and not chill-filtered. (The entry level Ardmore ""Traditional"" is at the opposite end of the age spectrum, tasting quite youthful.) My initial concern with this 30 year old was: would the wood dominate the lovely floral, smoky notes I enjoy so much with Ardmore? The wood is certainly present, but the smoke still comes through. There 's a gently layered sweetness that complements the smoke (toffee, deep caramel, subtle honey), licorice root, bourbon barrel char, coffee grounds, and high cocoa chocolate, with subtle dried citrus and a suggestion of floral soap. Dry finish, with more bourbon barrel char and licorice root. Considering that Ardmore has historically been a blending malt, most of the stocks right now are much younger. This is a rare treat. It 's a wee bit thin in body and a little on the dry side from 30 years on wood for me to rate it in the mid 90s, but it 's still a very enjoyable whisky."

Lovely antique amber color. The Madeira dovetails beautifully with the malt and oak, and it has matured nicely for a whisky less than ten years old. Lush notes of orange marmalade, raspberry tart, and panforte, all wrapped up in rich toffee and a dusting of nutmeg, cinnamon, and cocoa. A dry, resinous, spicy, tactile finish adds balance, complexity, and additional dimension. Smartly bottled at a higher strength. Some of these wine-finished Arran whiskies are impressive.

Soft, subtly seductive aromas of creamy vanilla, crÃ¨me brulee, tropical fruit, oak, and a hint of mint. Light to medium in body-silky in texture at first, then becoming and firm. On the palate, the whisky starts out gently sweet, with creamy vanilla and honeyed malt. Subtle tropical fruit notes arrive mid palate. The whisky then begins to dry out fairly rapidly (this is a 36 year old Lowland after all), as dry resinous notes of vanilla, mint, and herbs reveal themselves. The whisky finishes dry, with notes of soft leather. The way the owners of Auchentoshan and Glen Garioch are handling vintage bottlings now is that specialty retailer orders an entire cask and sells it exclusively. This one is a Sam's exclusive. It's older than the previous, widely distributed 1966 bottling and less expensive too! You wouldn't expect a triple distilled Lowland whisky to age so gracefully. Auchentoshan is an exception to the rule. It has acquired the depth and maturity from extensive aging, yet it still manages to maintain its distillery character and Lowland gentility. Only on the dry finish does it really show its age. But that's a small price to pay for an otherwise very good single cask whisky at a very reasonable price for 36 years old."

I 'm picking up plenty of sherry in this new expression, which I like. It finishes firmly dry, with notes of spice and tannin.

These are predominantly only for sale on site or by mail order through www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com.



My pick of this batch. Strathisla 's a small, traditional distillery whose make is mostly pressed into service for the Chivas Regal blends. It 's a hard to pin down malt, and it 's this elusive character that shows here: firm then soft, fragrant then deep. The nose is intense and spicy with wax, nougat, chocolate, hazelnut, and fresh-opened banana. The palate is explosive with real presence and power, whose firm core is softened by honey and poached fruits. Complex is the word. Â£37"

This, however, immediately shows promise. Gold in color, and while it 's another one that starts ever so slightly restrained, the giveaway peppery note soon reveals itself as smoked pimento and Szechuan pepper, mixed with extra virgin olive oil spread over hot smoked salmon. There 's also a touch of putty - something which you usually only see in youthful expressions - suggesting that here 's another refill maturation. 

As with many of these older whiskies, water isn 't the best option for the palate, but a drop does help release the sweet fruitiness that always lurks in Talisker 's heart, this time accompanied by an herbal note (mint and fennel). It 's almost as if it is looking back at itself as an 18 year old, but here the firm granitic grip of age takes hold.

The palate starts slowly but opens well with a gentle, yet assertive revealing of the aromas on the nose. It seems to dip in energy just in the center before sparking back to life when the smoke emerges, like the last flash of defiance from an old-timer."

In 1964, it was barley. The barley, combined with the fact that the whisky is finished off in port casks, makes for a surprisingly rich, sweet, and fruity grain whisky, expressing notes of demerara sugar, perfumed candles, cherry almond tart, caramel and vanilla.

618,Clan Denny,,,46.00%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,90,45,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,UK,620.0,"So which independent bottler comes out in the 'Big' battle of the Islay blended malts? Given this is bottled at a lower strength and it's at a lower price, I'm calling it a draw. The latest batch of this is the best yet, with Ardbeg, Caol Ila, and Bowmore the main components, although there is also some Port Ellen in the mix. So you know what to expectâand it doesn't disappoint. Big AND peaty."
619,Duncan Taylor,,,60.00%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,90,85,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,UK,621.0,"Brace yourself. This takes peat to the extreme, conjuring up a moist, chocolate slab of peat being cut and lifted out of the bog. So smoky, you will feel like you 're breathing in the dense clouds rising above the smoldering kilns. A punchy thwack of peat at full strength, and even if you cut it with water, it only highlights salty fishboxes and some buttery caramels cowering from the backdraft. A deliberately singular character, but utterly brilliant nonetheless.Â Â£46"

Here, Brian Kinsman has used whisky from Ladyburn and Inverleven to create a nose of zesty key lime pie, peach, butter mintoes, and sweet oak. It is truly moreish, with creamy, malty flavors of sweet mandarin, marzipan, and strawberry with a chalky mouthfeel of candy sticks that lingers through the finish. Exceptionally good whisky.

Rather tasty; the cask strength alcohol rips through the juicy mandarin and toffee opening, overcoming an active peppery middle section, then relinquishing its grip to leave herbal notes, corn, and fudge. Reverberating lengthy toffee and spice finish. Water brings out more cereal notes and soft orange."

The aroma is like a cobbler 's workshop: oils, leather, grease, polish, and then licorice. On the palate, there 's the prune notes of armagnac, the sweetness and cedar flavors of old rum, and very Rothes-esque spiciness. Water, just a drop, lightens it a little, allowing the underlying sweetness to show. Not cask dominated, just bottled at exactly the right moment. Recommended.Â Â£68"

A beautiful oxidized note, with soft fruitcake, steamed pudding, a little hint of overripe fruits, and sweet spices.

A silky texture with red apple, orange oils, and a luxuriantly refined taste leads to apple peelings, caramel, and ginger. Such quality!

Strawberry napoleon, mint leaves rubbed between finger and thumb, runny honey, fresh peach, and wood whittled on the back porch. The sweet orange starts gossamer light, then it hits the gas: the citrus becomes more tangy, touching blood orange, fizzy sweeties become taffy candy, then sherbet. Eventually pacified, it becomes milky and sweet, with milk chocolate melting on the tongue. A creamy finish like a mother 's embrace.Â Â£50"

There are heavy florals - think lilies and stewed white fruit, and just-overripe banana - but this is given a mysterious extra heft by an underpinning of a light meatiness, accompanied by a tiny lift of (good) sulfur. The palate is, unsurprisingly, thick and creamy with huge fruit that fills the mouth. A highly physical, old-style Speyside dram with classic distillery character.

While still prominent, there 's slightly less brine and seaweed, more earthiness, tar, soot, espresso, tobacco, grass, and chocolate fudge. The same goes for the palate. It starts out like a ""slightly more gutsy than normal"" cask strength, young Ardbeg (e.g., Renaissance) and, if you go into this experience expecting to be totally blown away by peat, tar, and smoke, you might feel a bit under-challenged initially. But the peat eventually builds to a powerful, lava-like crescendo and you realize that this is no ordinary Ardbeg. The length of the finish is seemingly endless; bold and warming. Through all this, there 's a soft underbelly of ripe barley and a vanilla sweetness to balance at least some of the tar, heat, and smoke -- something I admire in many Ardbegs. Bottom line: It 's an interesting, entertaining, and eye-opening experience. I like how mature it tastes for a relatively young whisky. But, like a whisky that shows just a bit too much sherry or oak, I think the extra peat, to a degree, masks the subtle complexities I admire in some other, lesser-peated Ardbegs, which is the only thing keeping me from scoring this whisky in the 90s. All smoky whisky enthusiasts should endeavor to try this at least once."

More of the same on the palate, with seaweed, smoked haddock, and cough drops emerging towards the finish. This whisky is very dynamic and exciting to drink. My only criticism: it comes across a little green on the finish, which keeps me from scoring it in the 90s. Still, it 's pretty impressive considering how young some of the whiskies in it are.

In between you'll enjoy flavors of peat smoke, vanilla, spicy pepper, and delicately honeyed malt, with just a hint of the sea. What I like most about this whisky is its impeccable balance-between youth and maturity, sweetness and dryness-with just the right amount of peat smoke to declare its Islay roots without smothering its other flavors."

The smoke gently glides along throughout. The palate is quite thick and shows sweetness and a slow release of soft fruit, with a tingle of salt. The smoke slowly increases until it concentrates on the back palate, giving an effect like burning pine logs on the beach. Becomes nicely funky in time. Recommended.Â Â£115"

These are backed with a thick, unsalted butter note that suggests that the cask might not have been as quiet as first imagined. Give it time, and out come boiled sweets and a fresh green note, like a just-whittled stick. A hint of wheat chaff and fragrant grasses brings to mind lying in a summer meadow watching the dust motes dance in the sunshine. The mouth is sweet and lemon-accented with a pickup of a pleasant chalkiness on the nose that gives it the suggestion of a fino sherry or Vin Jaune.

That one wasn 't sold here in the U.S., but this one is (although this one costs about four times as much as the original one did when it was released). Both were racked in used bourbon barrels before being finished in Hermitage red wine casks from northern Rhone. The best of these limited release Glenmorangies, like the Fino Sherry Finish expression several years ago, add complexity and intrigue without masking Glenmorangie 's lovely subtle complexity. This one does a pretty good job of it, although there 's a lot of fruit here (an obvious contribution of the wine).

Surprisingly balanced on the palate with an incredible depth and maturity. Its flavors are similar to its aroma, but a soft sweetness compliments the flavors and provides balance. Soothing, mellowing finish of considerable depth.

818,Springbank,,10 year old,49.90%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,89,66,Single Malt Scotch,UK,821.0,"More subtle and teasing. Not as much a knock-out punch on the finish like the Talisker 10 and 18, but rather more steady intense blows to the abdomen for many rounds. An aging Talisker, but still with many redeeming qualities. It is drier than its younger siblings, with less fruit and more of a stony texture, with dried spices and lingering leather notes. This whisky requires more patience and demands more concentration, but it is still rewarding to the seasoned aficionado (with some extra pocket change).

Not only couldn 't anyone pronounce it correctly (it 's ""Oth Rusk,"" in case you 're interested), but in recent years it 's seen its Singleton prefix hijacked by other larger distilleries - Glendullan, Dufftown, Glen Ord - leaving it somewhat forgotten by malt mavens. Part of the old J&B stable, it continues to make a malty/nutty spirit, a style which is also somewhat out of favor in the world of single malts. 

Maybe this bottling (in a rather spiffing retro pack) will redress the balance. The color is full gold, and though initially the nose shows the high bottling strength to the max, beneath the prickly heat is eucalyptus oil alongside those signature nutty/cereal notes. But here 's the difference; there 's sweetness, too: toffee and thick clover honey, even a touch of sawdust and pencil shavings before a drop of water brings out malted milk and powdered hazelnut. In other words, there 's plenty of distillery character, but good cask development. 

In the mouth, when neat, the needling alcohol slightly numbs the tongue and the effect from start to finish is a bit fragmented. Add water, however (not too much), and there 's a soft, creamy effect across the tongue with praline, almond, and a dark chocolate note as well.

This is signature Ardbeg: young (but not too young), bold, and with an attitude too! Its flavors are reminiscent of crumbled peat thrown on a campfire, with notes of damp earth, pepper, and seaweed. Still, there 's a soft underbelly of vanilla sweetness that helps to tame this beast and provide balance. A peppery, kippered, smoky finish entertains long after the whisky disappears.

It 's the smoke that you notice first, typically Highland-style wood smoke with a light aromatic lift akin to smoked meat. It 's not a bludgeoning smoke however, because BenRiach 's inherent orchard fruit sweetness is there alongside touches of beeswax. In other words, it has maturity.

I love the interplay here between the malt, sherry, and smoke, with all getting a chance to shine. A rich vanilla-tinged malty foundation, deep caramel, rhum agricole, an array of lush fruit and dark chocolate, along with grassy/hay notes, honeysuckle, subtle spice (cinnamon, anise), and lingering earthy smoke. A vast improvement from the ""Origins"" release last year. I would only make three changes to make this whisky even better (and elevate it to 90+ status): a couple more years on oak, bottling at 46%, and not chill-filtering it. Still, this is one of the best efforts from this distillery. Well done!

Here, distillery weight and time work in tandem to give a nose that has slightly overripe orchard fruits, smoke, and Seville orange. The palate then heads into the hedgerowsâhawthorn and currant jamâbefore a waxiness emerges. The finish reveals a mix of smoke and mint. All in all, an excellent dram. Â£425"

Water adds some elegance and weight. This sweetness continues on the palate, where there 's toffee, raisin, ripe fruits, and slow-burning peatiness, fully integrated and ember-like on the back palate.

Fresh, appetizing aroma and flavor of brine, delicate peat, gentle sweetness, and a touch of spice and seaweed. Medium in body and slightly oily in texture. Nicely balanced and clean, with a salty, dryish finish. This is a lovely, very appetizing expression of a distillery that has been closed and dismantled. (It was the original Clynelish distillery.) It is a very nice example of a northern Highland whisky, and expresses a great balance between sweetness and brine, youth and maturity.

Assertive with banana, roasted red pepper, paprika, and a hit of barbecued pork glazed with pomegranate molasses. The palate has blazing heat, but also oiliness and real density. The peat doesn 't so much rumble as sit there in a cloud: opaque, impenetrable. Even water cannot unlock it. Rooty and tarry, this is not a dram for the fainthearted. Â£65 (500 ml)"

On the palate it 's a different story, as ashy smoke combines with raisin and rancio, turning the peat age detriment into an asset. Strangely alluring, it 's like sitting on a park bench next to a weathered old man who ends up having a real tale to tell.Â  (U.S. only)"

My suitcases were getting quite heaving on my return trips from Scotland. This is a splendid Coal Ila. It is wonderfully vibrant. Understandably, the immediate impact on the palate is the peat smoke, but there's so much else going on here, too: smoked olives, seaweed, salt and pepper, all placed on a gently sweet bed of toffee and vanilla fudge.

Interwoven spice (especially pepper), seaweed, and sweet & sour notes add complexity. Light to medium in body, but quite oily. Nicely balanced flavors of peat smoke, seaweed, salt & pepper, all wrapped up in a gentle sweetness. Lingering peat smoke and spice on the finish. Yet another example of Caol Ila's fine pedigree. This bottling has great balance, and I especially enjoy how the smoke and sweetness marry together. My only criticism is that it is a bit soft for Caol Ila. I would love to try this whisky at 46 or 50% ABV, which would give it a bit more guts."
955,Bunnahabhain,,15 year old,54.30%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,88,99,Single Malt Scotch,UK,958.0,"A rounded and mature affair. The 25 years in oak has made it a bit more refined (and drier on the palate) compared to younger expressions. All the classic Caol Ila notes are stillthere-mustard, seaweed, olives, damp peat, salt and pepper. A touch of vanilla wafer, anise, smoked almonds, and tarry rope add complexity. Those of you who prefer Ardbeg 17 over the 10, and Laphroaig 15 over the 10, will be attracted to this whisky when compared to Caol Ila's younger siblings. But at $225, it's an expensive date, isn't it?"

Not a heavy-bodied whisky, but it throws a strong punch. Notes of tarry rope infused with seaweed and brine, all on an oily, malty, vanilla foundation. Throw in some orchard fruit, Manzanilla olive, black licorice stick, and soot, with brine and Tellicherry pepper on the finish. Clean, fun, and dynamic.

957,Gordon & MacPhail,,15 year old,40.00%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,88,85,Single Malt Scotch,UK,960.0,"Caol Ila makes unpeated whisky for blenders, but it rarely gets bottled as a single malt. Here 's a very revealing opportunity to find out what Caol Ila tastes like without the smoke. Good viscosity and rather sweet, showing thick, honeyed vanilla, gobs of fruit (lemon drops, lime tart, ripe Bartlett pear, kiwi), mint jelly, and cut grass. Its sea influence finally emerges towards the finish with brine and just a hint of seaweed. Bruichladdich and Bunnahabhain are now bottling peated whiskies, and Caol Ila does just the opposite. This is an interesting diversion, but I am missing the added dimension of peat smoke in this Caol Ila.

This is a dignified and complex malt, which doesn 't give everything up immediately. There 's soft pear and guava on the nose, and the trademark oiliness and distinctive peat are there, but there 's a buttery quality, too, as well as some brine and spice, apple pip, and traces of aniseed. You get a sense of its age late on, with some oaky tannins and sharper spice, but overall this is an unhurried, complex, and sweet whisky with just enough peat to keep it honest. Very impressive.

Rather than this just being Caol Ila with the peat stripped out, the team made it in a different fashion - but there are still hints of commonality. 

For example, the grassy note that usually lies beneath the smoke is the lead aroma here, and it 's not any old grass, but wet grass - like skidding on a football (soccer) field. The mind keeps looking for smoke, but apart from a hint of birch smoke (which could come from the (refill) cask), it 's whistle-clean and fruity, and with a touch of water, fills with an aroma of toffee popcorn, custard, and pears. 

The palate continues in this light fashion with melon balls and fruit cocktail. This potentially bland fleshiness is given a perkiness thanks to the high alcohol and, again, a jag of acidity. Bizarrely, on the finish, I pick up slight saltiness. A fun dram."

As you would expect, it is nicely matured, but it is surprisingly clean and well rounded, too! Exotic notes of dried fruits, sultana, subtle (but viscous) honey, sandalwood, and a potpourri of spice (especially cinnamon, anise, ginger). Clean, subtly spicy finish.

I prefer it to the 12 year old and the price is fantastic."

Smoked fish, in fact, with some linked oily elegance, along with touches of hot tar and a cooked agave quality, adding a slightly sour/sweet element; then come poached pear and pepper. The palate is rootier, but always with this deep, clinging texture. As it moves it sweetens briefly, then comes creosote. Water gives the sweetness more space before the big phenols come powering back. It 's a barbecue in your mouth. Classic Laphroaig, in fact.Â Â£91"

And when one does become available, it will be pushing 20 years old or older, like this one. When young, Linlithgow often exhibits a freshness and drinkability, with a gentle maltiness and often hay or grassy notes for complexity. How does this older one fare? Quite well, actually. I was concerned that this whisky would have too much oak influence, given how old it is and how delicate the whisky can be. While those years in a hogshead add some dry spicy notes, they are never excessive. Instead, they add a complexity that blends in nicely with notes of creamy malt, vanilla, lemon gum drops, grass and hay. I am particularly impressed by the evolution of flavors on the palate and the length and depth of its dry, spicy finish. Certainly one of the best Linlithgows to come onto the market.

Velvety and slightly oily in texture, and fragrant. The whisky is balanced, the flavors clean, with no hint of excessive oak. Bourbon cask-aging offers up notes of vanilla wafer, along with coconut cream, honey, and a touch of caramel. Bright fruit (lemon meringue, pineapple, apricot) keeps the whisky lively, and suggestions of hay and linseed offer continued entertainment. Nutty, toasted oak finish. If you are looking for a Linlithgow (AKA St. Magdalene) to purchase before the whisky becomes impossible to find, I can recommend this one.

Prophecy is also bottled at 46% and not chill-filteredâwhich I think brings out more subtle nuances and texture in the whisky. The only tradeoff is that I 'm picking up less of the Jura spirit and less sea characteristics. But this is a small tradeoff, considering how much more you 're getting with Prophecy.

I know of at least one 15 year old, an 18 year old, a 19 year old, a 1968 vintage, and four different 12 year old versions. My favorite of the range was the limited edition 19 year old released here in the U.S. about a decade ago. The 1968 Vintage, which you can still find on retailers ' shelves, is also a worthy dram. But this new 12 year old ""Original"" expression is certainly my favorite of the 12s (and the 15). I feel that Glendronach expresses itself best when it is not dominated by the sherry, allowing a greater balance of flavors. This whisky was originally matured in sherry casks, but was then (fortunately) aged in bourbon casks for the remainder of its maturation. The result? A richly flavored, nicely balanced whisky expressing notes of sherried fruit, burnt caramel, light toffee, and nuts, all underpinned by a soothing malty foundation. Yum!

1263,Chieftain,,21 year old,55.80%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,87,140,Single Malt Scotch,UK,1266.0,"Deep gold color. Nicely balanced aroma of honeyed malt, fruit, floral notes, and a hint of the sea. Medium in body and smooth. The palate begins with soothing honey notes, followed by a rich maltiness. Ripe fruit flavors emerge, lush and delicious. The whisky eventually becomes dry and floral, with a suggestion of salt.

Soft and sweet on the palate, with pink grapefruit, overt smoke, and a touch of salt. The finish features contrasting barbecue and vanilla notes, citrus, and lots of spice."

Just 30,000 rather extravagantly presented bottles are available globally.Â  Fresh and fruity on the nose with light trademark Highland Park sweet smoke, ginger, and a hint of dry earth. In time the fruits become more clearly defined as pears and peaches. Full and viscous on the palate; vanilla, pepper, brief orchard fruits, then dry peat, licorice, aniseed, and a lingering, relatively dry finish."

Slightly smoky orchard fruits on the early palate, with sultanas, ripe cherries, and cinnamon. Medium to long in the finish, with drying fruit notes, wood spice, and ultimately, licorice sticks.

The nose is fragrant, with canned pears and vanilla ice cream, coconut, and a very subtle wisp of smoke. Quite thin on the palate, nutty, mildly herbal, with tropical fruits. Ashy peat smoke, cocoa powder, and wood spice in the medium-length finish."
1269,Highland Park,,,45.90%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,87,71,Single Malt Scotch,UK,1272.0,"Amber copper color. Very mature aroma of oak, damp earth, peat smoke, licorice, soft citrus, and seaweed. Full-bodied and somewhat oily. A gently sweet vanilla note up front-albeit very briefly-then a quick flash of citrus fruit and seaweed. After that it's a battle between peat smoke and oak, with the oak ultimately winning. Very long, dry, smoky finish."

1271,Highland Park,,,47.20%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,87,100,Single Malt Scotch,UK,1274.0,"Matured in a sherry cask. Chock full of ripe fruit, but still quite feminine in personality. Firm malt foundation, almost buttery in texture, with juicy oak, maple syrup, raspberry (red and black), strawberry, and dates, peppered with gentle spice (cinnamon, ginger). While this is a very enjoyable whisky, I have tasted some excellent Linkwood bottlings, including the standard 12 year old from back in the early 1990s, that brandished less sherry, allowing more of Linkwood 's gentle nature to blossom. Still, the sherry influence here is pristine, and it gives as much as it masks. (430 bottles)Â£200"

The nose speaks of caramel toffee, demerara sugar, and while an oaky touch is there it 's light, allowing plump sultanas, rose, and a delightful balsamic cider vinegar note to emerge. The palate is relaxed and gentle, with darker fruits. There 's sufficient body to cope with the tannic squeeze. It needs water to reach ideal balance. Lovely. Â£65"

Voluptuous in the mouth, with a palate of rich peat, summer berries, and toffee apples, with growing spice notes, and light oak. Lengthy in the finish, with cinnamon, peat, sweet oak, and red berries."

A sherry hoggieÂ  helped provide sultana, cake mix, grilled almond, rhubarb puree, and a little cigar box. The palate is very fruity, with light Darjeeling-like tannins, then red fruits. It becomes nuttier as it moves and needs water to add ripeness to the stone fruit base. Highly recommended and extremely well priced.Â Â£80"
1275,The Whisky Exchange,,16 year old,48.00%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,87,108,Single Malt Scotch,UK,1278.0,"Amber mahogany color. Its 50 years of age are evident in the nose-there's plenty of resinous wood spice notes (especially clove). Also on the nose is citrus (especially orange), a potpourri of dried fruit, light toffee, and a hint of smoked nuts. The body is thick and viscous. The palate expresses flavors similar to its aroma, finishing dry and long."

Auburn in color, it has a fruit compote nose mixed with citrus, and a little hint of gravy browning in the background. This mix of the exoticâoil of clove on the tongue, the sweet and light gripâmakes for a very intriguing, concentrated, and layered palate. Think of Turkish Delight and crystallized ginger.

This is a vatting of different sized American and (mostly) European oak casks, so no surprise that it 's oak-led, but Macallan is a heavy distillate and it needs oak to prosper fully. Here you get rosin, marmalade, green fig jam, and the power of concentrated oils. The palate is powerful and supple, with some clove, ginger, and yet more chocolate.

The 'entry level ' 12 year old expression is widely available. The nose presents pleasingly fresh malt and floral notes, with a touch of pine. The palate offers a fuller bodied, sweeter whisky than the nose might lead one to expect, with more malt, spices, fresh fruit, and a suggestion of salt. The finish is medium in length, drying, and decidedly nutty."

Full-bodied and slick in the mouth, overt sherry, sultanas, figs, spice, and contrasting brine. Mild maritime notes and autumn fruits combine with prunes and sherry in an accomplished, after-dinner finish. Â£55/liter"

Initially matured in second-fill American oak and bourbon casks, it was finished in bourbon casks that previously held heavily peated whisky. Sweet woodsmoke, crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, green apples, and cinder toffee on the nose. The smoke is more peat-induced on the palate, with banana fritters, and subtly sprinkled with sea salt. The finish features caramel and herbal notes."
1286,Pentland Skerries,,,46.00%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,87,92,Single Malt Scotch,UK,1289.0,"Here 's a classical Port Ellen, where the intense, even monomaniacal delivery of smoke mixes with damp face flannel, purple smoke, green ferns, and rapeseed oil. Lots of minerality, to the point of being almost flintily uncompromising. Water makes it more naked. The palate is excellent, with an explosion of preserved lemon-accented smokiness, touches of Spanish paprika, a sweet syrupy center, before a massive licorice finish. Peatiness for the purist, but whenever was that different? (2,958 bottles)."

Creamy and soothing, with a gently dry finish. Lots of depth for a lighter weight whisky. A lovely aperitif. I feel Rosebank is freshest and best when it is young. With the distillery closing in 1993, now 's the time to act, and this is one of the better bottlings I 've tasted.

The 12, 16, and 21 year old expressions are initially available in ten markets, Including the UK, U.S., and Canada.

More restrained on the nose than the 12 and 16 year old variants, with green apples, melons, and damp grass. The palate is silky and refined, with fresh fruits, just a hint of sherry, light spice, and a wisp of smoke. Aniseed and drying old oak in the earthy, lengthy finish."

All four are solid efforts - it 's really a matter of personal preference. A general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. While this is nice, I would love to see several single cask, cask strength, and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 



Citrus, exotic wood, and botanicals on the nose and palate. Indeed, there 's a bit of intrigue here. Nice balance, with roasted nuts, pecan pie, and more exotic wood on the finish."

Syrupy notes of fruitcake, burnt fig, raisin, and beeswax are balanced by resinous oak, polished leather, roasted nuts, and dried spice on the finish.

Thought-provoking aromas and flavors of molasses, leather, vanilla, and wood spices, with a hint of bourbon and rum. Light to medium in body.

A honeyed, sultana sweetness (from the d 'Yquem?) nicely tames the rooty smoke, iodine, seaweed, brine, pepper, and subtle Spanish olive. Bramble and berried fruit (from the Grenache?) add another layer and dimension. A very dynamic whisky, worthy of exploring and debating how well all these flavors integrate with each other."

peaches, to develop alongside crisp apple. The palate is clean with nutty oak, with

the smoke continuing in the background, offering an extra layer of complexity.

Fresh, belying its age, while it has typical tongue-coating oiliness it remains

A rippling kind of muscularity with some rapeseed oil. With water the palate starts lighter and more fruity than you 'd expect, then comes rooty weight with, yes, a distinctly gingery slant.

Brooding, with licorice root, coal tar, bacon fat, damp peat, bright fruit (citrus and pear), and intriguing botanicals, all on a soothing bed of vanilla malt. Smoky, briny finish.

The 17 year old was pleasant enough, but quite sweet (I rated it an 80). This new Golden Cask is an improvement, because the higher alcohol level, along with an array of dried spice, helps to balance the sweet rum notes. Lively, bright tangerine, nectarine, and pineapple combine with Balvenie 's signature honey, nougat, Heath bar, light molasses, and milk chocolate. Dried spice (vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg) and gritty oak resin kick in on the finish, rounding everything out quite nicely.

The standard distillery issue of Longmorn 15 year old itself is a big whisky-one of the biggest in Speyside with its rich, malty foundation-but this expression kicks it up a notch. Aging 31 years in a sherry butt injects this whisky with a lot more sherry character along with those woody, citrus spicy notes found in so many older whiskies. While not as clean as the distillery issue and its maltiness is somewhat masked, there 's a lot going on here to entertain the palate.

The nose offers warm spices, walnuts, malt, peaches in cream, honey, vanilla, and a slightly herbal, earthy note. Quite robust on the palate for its strength, with spice, sweet sherry, and mildly smoky orchard fruit. The finish is relatively long, with cocoa powder, citrus fruit, and ginger."

Springbank bottlings over the past few years have been variable, but improving. The less inspiring ones have been too heavily sherried and/or lacked the classic Springbank freshness, liveliness, and briny character one has come to expect from a Campbeltown whisky. This one is indeed from a sherry cask. It's still not the classic Springbanks we were spoiled with in the 1990s, but it's delicious nonetheless. Yes, there's plenty of sherry (and these notes contribute lush fruit, toffee, and nuts), but the youth and zest of this whisky cuts through it and balances it nicely, with those familiar brine and coconut notes interwoven throughout. A bold and satisfying Springer, with more character that the 175th Anniversary 12 year old distillery bottling that has been in circulation."

But it 's this malt that will probably attract the most interest. Glengyle was officially re-opened in 2004, and in recent years Springbank has released a work in progress each year. What makes this unusual is the fact that the maturing malt is held in a cask which is kept at least half full, and each year it is topped up with malt from 2004, through the solera method. This year, then, the oldest malt is six years old. The nose definitely suggests a work in progress, and is immature, rootsy, and meaty, though some orange and citrus fruit notes are there, too. On the palate there 's plenty to be encouraged by, with some spearmint and menthol, developing fruitiness, earthy peat, and distinctive salt and spice."

The palate continues this theme with the fruits (blueberry, raspberry, and pomegranate) typical of the distillery character, given a waxy coating by age. Unctuous and good. Water rather pulls the flesh from the bones, revealing its age, so leave well enough alone. (3,756 bottles)"

After an initial blast of marzipan there 's rosin, stewed Assam tea, some licorice, hard treacle toffee, truffle, and a charred element, all backed with an earthy undertow. The palate is tight and quite hot, with charred red pepper and a bosky, wooded note.

It develops spiced orange notes, lime, soft summer fruits, vanilla, and Milka chocolate, encased in a thick, dense mouthfeel with nutmeg, dried peel, and powdered chocolate.

Peaty bonfire aroma and flavors, complemented by a creamy caramel maltiness. Subtle notes of brine, seaweed, and a hint of pear fruit spice things up a bit. Gently dry, moderately smoky finish, with teasing sea salt notes. I have always wondered what a peat smoke infused Isle of Jura whisky would taste like. I was also concerned that too much peat smoke could dominate this whisky's flavor profile. Fortunately, this hasn't happened. The peat smoke is certainly evident, but the Jura character comes through too. One extra bonus: it's bottled at 45%, which kicks the flavors up a notch."

Major components of The Famous Grouse blended whiskies have included The Macallan and Highland Park, and there 's no doubt these malts are providing some of the richness and flavor complexity in this new expression.

A success. Â£100"

That mineral note continues on the palate, which broadens into ginger nuts in the middle of the tongue. All very well-balanced, and at its best neat."

Toffee, salted pecans, Dundee cake, and sultana aromas. A beautiful, thick texture replete with ripe red fruits, cardamom, fennel, and star anise. Caramels drift past on a river of spice, wreathed in a fine layer of smoke, then oak, mixed nuts, and cracker bread.

Ripening strawberries, cotton candy, and fudge on the nose, but with an undertow of devil-may-care spiciness.

Notes of sticky toffee, vanilla fudge, bramble, and red currant give way to oak resin, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and subtle lemongrass.

Â Â Â The owners of Blair Athol have chosen not to export this whisky to the U.S. For this reason it can be rather difficult to find, only occasionally being imported by one of the independent bottlers. This particular expression is a very good example from this distillery."
1860,Benromach,,12 year old,50.00%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,84,80,Single Malt Scotch,UK,1863.0,"This distillery-only bottling strips away the sweet gloopiness of the standard 12 year old - and is all the better for that. The nose is soft and gentle, with rose petals and rose hips over a base of ripe plum and a touch of ginger cake. The palate is intriguing and holds the attention, with citrus fruits, bitter apple, spice, and a touch of peppermint. It is all very clean, sophisticated, and pleasant. The finish is long and warming, and the overall experience is highly enjoyable. Justified as a distillery-only bottling? Without a doubt."

Sweet and fruity on the nose, majoring in tinned pineapple in syrup. Toffee, nougat, and a hint of freshly-dug soil make up the supporting aromatic cast. Full bodied and initially as sweet in the mouth as it was on the nose, with vigorous spices, particularly nutmeg, then it begins to dry. The long finish is characterized by powdery cocoa and oak tannins. Â£80"
1862,Cadenhead,,,58.10%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,84,90,Single Malt Scotch,UK,1865.0,"There have been some legendary Hart Brothers bottlings of Bowmore (the 1966 bottled in '74 is a classic) so this has a lot to live up to. The nose is creamy and discreet, but Bowmore is less about charging out wreathed in smoke and more a dram where peat is part of the totality. Here you get seashells and low-tide aromas, along with green banana. The palate is gently smoked with light barley, cool melon. An afternoon dram.Â Â£50"
1863,Blair Athol,,,55.80%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,84,100,Single Malt Scotch,UK,1866.0,"Sadly, the final chapter in a series which deservedly acquired cult status because of the way it showed how well Bowmore behaved in close proximity to sherry casks. This was aged in oloroso and PX and has a thick, dark nose, all dried black fruits and saddlebags. The smoke is sotto voce. The savory nature continues on the palate. It needs water to bring out fresh fruits, and while there 's a bitterness on the end, that 's a minor cavil. Â£190"
1864,Duncan Taylor,,22 year old,50.50%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,84,125,Single Malt Scotch,UK,1867.0,"This vatting of three virgin oak casks and one oloroso butt was so keenly priced that it sold out in seconds, all 1,500 bottles of it. It shows Bowmore, that ever-changing, elusive Islay dram in perfumed, scented mode. I picked up vetiver (an integral part of classic male cologne), but also peach, some flamed peels, and plenty of smoke. The palate dips into the sea for a second, then again becomes scented, alongside gentle chocolate. Amazing price too. Â£55"

"
1866,Bowmore,,,56.70%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,84,274,Single Malt Scotch,UK,1869.0,"Aged in refill sherry casks. One taste bears this out with its dominant honeyed fruit foundation (lemons, melons, pineapple). Still, that Bruichladdich freshness and appetizing ""sea breeze"" character dovetails nicely. Fuller, more rounded, and with a bit more going on here than the Full Strength expression reviewed below, but not as appetizing.

A fresh, appetizing whisky of brine and white pepper, with an underlying foundation of vanilla, barley, and grassy/hay-like notes. A very subtle teasing of citrus lingers throughout. Very clean and straight-forward, with an appetizing finish. A whisky aperitif? 

"
1868,Bruichladdich,,,46.00%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,84,75,Single Malt Scotch,UK,1871.0,"It is unusual to find a Bruichladdich whisky with this much sherry influence-this one is aged in a refill sherry hogshead. I must admit that I generally like a less sherried Bruichladdich-it makes it easier to appreciate the distillery's subtle complexities. While there certainly is more than enough sherry to go around in this whisky, the distillery character does manage to fight its way through. This whisky's strong point is that the sherry influence is clean and not insipid like some sherried whiskies. Chewy caramel, toffee, and ripe fruit notes are most evident in this whisky, with Bruichladdich's signature-an appetizing fresh briny character-emerging midway on the palate through to the finish. If you like Bruichladdich and you appreciate a cleanly sherried whisky, then I think you'll enjoy this one."
1869,Bruichladdich,,14 year old,46.00%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,84,75,Single Malt Scotch,UK,1872.0,"Fruit is the common thread to this lightly peated whisky; red fruit, that is. Red raspberry, red currant, red seedless grape, strawberry, and red apple. A gentle sweetness (creamy vanilla, light molasses) balances all this fruit. Not overly contemplative, but delightful. This is definitelyÂ  not the same Rocks I reviewed two years ago. It is richer, darker in color, and tastes more mature. It's an improved version, and my rating reflects this."

This glimpse into the developing program shows what seems initially to be a delicately fragile dram that soon reveals an intense sweet depth behind the spring flowers. This purity of intent continues on the palate with a thick creaminess that 's typical of the distillery, while a tart finish adds interest. Precocious, but already beautifully balanced.Â£38"
1871,Gordon & MacPhail,1989.0,,57.90%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,84,65,Single Malt Scotch,UK,1874.0,"More from Bruichladdich. The latest in the Elements series is clean in a freshly-showered kind of fashion. The fact that it 's backed up with bran, agave syrup, and pancake batter just helps to emphasize this image of a sunlit breakfast. The palate is sweet, fat, and juicy, typical of how texture is as important as flavor with the Laddie. In time there 's some cinnamon with a preserved lemon acidity that enlivens the finish. Â£55 (500 ml)"
1872,Bruichladdich,,,46.00%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,84,50,Single Malt Scotch,UK,1875.0,"Some single malts just suit specific cask types. Such is the case with Bunnahabhain and sherry. The spirit has a soft and nutty undertow, plus a gingery note that is given weight and depth by the cask. Amontillado, with its nuttier character, is an ideal bridge between the two. This shows surprising maturity with more oxidized and mulch aromas alongside coffee grounds, and a character that 's drifting into meaty. Brooding, medium-bodied, slightly dryâ¦but the price? Ouch!

1873,Bruichladdich,,5 year old,50.00%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,84,60,Single Malt Scotch,UK,1876.0,"Without water, this is an aggressive malt, sharp and acerbic. With water, it 's still more in your face than any official bottling. Where you tend to associate Caol Ila with oily, peaty, and maritime characteristics, this is altogether more feisty and ballsier, with a glance to the big three peaty distilleries in the south of Islay, and even a nod to its peppery cousin on Skye. On the nose there is peat, but it is tempered by dark chocolate; some citrus there, too. The taste is quite sharp, with bitter lemon, licorice, and sooty peat to the fore. Certainly an interesting take on this intriguing distillery, and far removed from last year 's relatively gentle 25 year old release, but there are questions over the balance, and whether it 's a better whisky is a moot point."
1874,Elements of Islay Br4,,,54.70%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,84,85,Single Malt Scotch,UK,1877.0,"Pale straw. Delicate and a little akin to chilled manzanilla sherry: fresh almond, salinity, light yeast. Vibrant, with the smoke held in check. The palate is much sweeter, with finally some cask-derived sugars beginning to show. Then it rushes to the shoreline and takes a gulp of water, giving an effect like saltwater taffy. It needs water to flesh the palate out.Â Â£60/500 ml"
1875,Bunnahabhain,,16 year old,54.00%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,84,325,Single Malt Scotch,UK,1878.0,"This single cask bottling of Clynelish from Wemyss Malts is 16 years old, and just 302 bottles were yielded by the bourbon hogshead in which maturation took place. Milk chocolate, orange, and malt on the nose; fragrant, with stem ginger. Zesty and notably spicy on the palate, with applesauce, peaches, and digestive biscuits. Relatively long in the finish, with oak, allspice, and persistent fruitiness.Â£67"
1876,Caol Ila,,,58.40%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,84,153,Single Malt Scotch,UK,1879.0,"If you 're looking for a bold, dry, spicy Speysider, this is the one. There 's lots of oak here, with bourbon undertones. A fighting vanilla sweetness manages to keep the whisky from becoming too austere. Gritty texture, with cedar wood, clove, spearmint, anise, herbal notes, dried fruit, and dark chocolate. A whisky that awakens the palate. Very invigorating. (Exclusive to The Whisky Exchange, London.)Â  Price: approximately $100.

Sweet, but with a steady dose of dried spice, oak resin, and teasing tobacco to back it up. Silky texture and lush, with fallen orchard fruit, tangerine, chocolate-covered orange, and lemon meringue. A firm dried spice finish rounds it all out. Sort of like The Dalmore 12 year old pumped up on steroids."
1878,Wemyss,,,46.00%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,84,108,Single Malt Scotch,UK,1881.0,"Matured in oloroso casks. The oloroso takes what is typically a pleasingly honeyed, but not particularly complex, malt and adds a layer of fruit to it. Crisp, clean notes of lemon, pineapple, and ginger, are softened by honeyed malt, vanilla, and hay. Soft, lingering finish.

From the freezer, concentrated aromas of pineapple, hints of honey and smoke. At room temperature, less intense fruitiness, more honey, and ginger. A syrupy mouthfeel from the freezer, with soft spices and orchard fruits. The palate is more complex at room temperature, with heathery spice, pepper, apricots, raisins, and milk chocolate.

There 's a lot going on in this whisky. Yeah, it 's still a little on the young side, but what it lacks in maturity is compensated by a dynamic youthful complexity. A distinctive whisky, with coal tar, damp kiln smoke, caramelized fruit, smoked almond, walnut, licorice stick, and maple-cured bacon. Youthful, sweet, smoky, lingering finish. I 'm looking forward to future releases. (6,000 bottles released, but only 900 to the U.S.).

The nose is fragrant, featuring summer berries and glacÃ© cherries, while the palate suggests canned pineapple with cream, contrasting with red wine notes. The finish is quite lengthy, with raspberries, spicy oak, and a whiff of smoke."

The finish is medium to long, with ashy peat and slightly bitter citrus fruits."
1883,Edradour,,,46.00%,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,84,100,Single Malt Scotch,UK,1886.0,"A nice example of what port wood finishing should do for a whisky. The port influence (finished one year in a port pipe) has taken what would normally have been a fairly straight-forward whisky when it is young-clean, light, and dry with subtle notes of herbs and spices-and added some extra weight along with balancing sweet toffee and full fruit, without dominating.

Fortunately, this is one of the nicer ones. The balance of sherry and oak is commendable, and the flavor is clean with that Glen Grant ""dried herb"" character still evident. Sweet fruit notes (berries in honey, peach pits, sultana, ripe grape) along with almonds and tobacco fill out the palate. Clean, warming finish.

The fruits manage to mix the ripe and slightly sour. Quite intense; it needs water, which calms proceedings allowing typical Glen Grant purity to come through. The fruits now have some added weight and, again, that smokiness. Intriguing!Â Â£75"

Rather than big phenols there 's an aroma of lanolin, sautÃ©ed scallop, fleshy fruit, and real sweetness. The palate shoes some oozing oils and a whiff of creosote, but this is a tea party rather than a wild ceilidh. Maybe bottling at 46% would have given the drive that 's missing."

The whisky is very clean and creamy, with lovely floral notes (lavender, heather, rose), intertwined with spices (especially vanilla), and fruit (baked apple, pineapple, coconut).

The nose is soft and sweet, with praline and a touch of condensed sweet malt joining creamed vanilla. Without water, the malt is surprisingly robust and prickly. Dilute it, though, and it 's a very pleasant drink, with crystallized grapefruit, traces of hickory and menthol, some honey, and sweet candy. Later on, spice comes through, and the finish is long, fruity, and spicy. An interesting take, but not a radical departure from the official bottling."

If it plays a role in this mix it's a submissive one then, because after a not altogether enticing nose that has gooseberry, green salad, and some prickly chili pepper, the palate is all about a mouth-coating big pepper hit that stays long into the finish. â¬40"

The creosote, damp outbuilding, and oily rope nose is distinctive and strong, the peat pronounced in the taste, though gooseberry, green melon, and a trace of kumquat are also in the mix, and there's pepper in there too. But ultimately the peat holds out and brings up the finish."

Golden Grahams, sanded oak, whole lemon, floral blooms, and cumin seeds on the nose, but the whole confection is rather restrained. The palate is sweet, but could be too sweet for some; Scottish tablet, caramel, ripe banana, granulated sugar, and ginger loaf. Some late heat accompanies the sugary finish. Remember to brush your teeth before bed."
1963,Double Barrel,,,46.00%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,84,49,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,UK,1966.0,"Custard creams, lemon peel, and clotted cream create easygoing aromas on this drop from the mighty Edinburgh grain distillery. The palate moves rapidly through flavors of lemon cake and lime zest, to grapefruit sharpness and fresh pineapple, reaching a plateau of sherbet and tangerine. Like a bulldog chewing a wasp, there 's lip-puckering sharpness throughout, though it 's judiciously dosed with sufficient sweetness to counterbalance it. A great introduction to the delights of the single grain category. (117 bottles)Â Â£48"

Crystallized lemon slices, green banana, solvents, dry grasses, and a sniff of nail polish remover. In the mouth, lemon flavors, saccharine sweet honey, and banana dipped in melted chocolate, while the alcohol nips at the tongue. A good trajectory redeems its character, leaving deep throbbing spice notes in the finish, with bitter citrus at the fringes."

Spice, sweetness, and citrus fight for dominance. Spice wins with a K.O. on sweetness and lays the citrus out cold on the canvas. Creamy chocolate notes tarnished with hot pepper on the finish, though coffee-pot flavors emerge with a dash of water."

This is less sweet than most blends, with tobacco leaf and ashtray to the fore, and a dusty, grainy note with a touch of oak, grape skin, and sweet heather. That said, not a lot of evidence of the 12 years in cask."

Anyway, here you have yeastiness and a smell like just-baked, sugar-topped apple pie, the fruit cracking through warm pastry. Sweet, direct, and slightly nervy, Braes is never going to be a heavy hitter, but this is the ideal dram to conjure up fading memories of summer."

It's hard not to view this as a victory of style over substance, and I object to premium whiskies being just 40% ABV, but nevertheless this is excellently made and the blending of whiskies over 21 years is exemplary.

1971,Royal Salute,,,40.00%,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,84,270,Blended Scotch Whisky,UK,1974.0,"Pale straw. This is a classic young Caol Ila, all elbows and knees. There is sweetness, but it 's counteracted by this briny edge and an aroma like firelighters in among smoldering peat. Shut your eyes and it could be mezcal. The smoke envelops the palate while you pick out edible seaweed and smoked oyster on the tongue. Very bright and would make a good aperitif/highball.Â Â£50"

Smooth, thick, and viscous, with light lemon, honey, gentle spices, peach melba, and toffee. The finish is silky and mouth-coating; rich and luxuriant.

Oak is quite present on the nose, but it's not alone: there's also bright citrus, pine, and white cake. The opening is softer with vanilla and apricot, but it's only a brief respite before a very spicy mid-palate focused around oak and white pepper. There is a fair amount of fire from the alcohol, which drives a very spicy and dry finish. (U.S. only)"

Weetabix, hazelnut shells, and the aroma of warm pretzels from a street vendor waft out of the glass. It 's a soft, silky, wheat-flavored whisky that reaches into dark toffee and nutty territory. Imagine a molten toffee crisp, if you like. A nougat and walnut-whip finish. Distinctively different."

The blend is then finished for four years in oloroso casks. It's a bit of blending gymnastics. Very sherry influenced, with marionberry jam, malt, salt, and oak. The integration and flavors are nice, but it all feels a bit muted. A medium length and dry finish shows off some of the younger spirit in the mix. (U.S. only)"

Warm marmalade, nuts, and oak flavors with whispers of cinnamon and clove combine to produce a creamy, smooth dram. It builds and builds but never feels like it fully arrives.

Good cask interaction here, allowing a light tropical fruit element to emerge alongside peach and apricot. Juicy and sweet, in other words, with none of the usual Tormore rigidity. The palate is equally concentrated, showing some heat, with a decent degree of fleshy elegance. Water brings out more dry elements: brown bracken, hayloft.

The blend has a creamy texture, with good weight to carry the flavors of orange peel, mango, and dried pineapple, leading to a zesty spark on swallowing. Wood spices, nuttiness, and lingering toffee make for a satisfying finish. The extra Madeira maturation is understated and perfectly judged."

Its name derives from the fact that the whisky is aged in American oak bodies with French Oak heads (a cross of both oaks). There 's no age statement, but the whiskies are all older than ten years. This is a gentle, subtly complex, somewhat lithe, easy drinking whisky (and with less oak spice than its predecessor, The Spice Tree). People think whisky is an after-dinner drink, but I think this would make a great aperitif because of its delicate dry spice notes and light body. I 'm picking up evenly-proportioned notes of vanilla and coconut, with more subtle notes of clove, anise, and delicate fruit, all wrapped up in a gentle, malty body. A very versatile whisky.

Previously rough and gutsy, this is softer, with more licorice and treacle but also more younger sappiness. Smoke has the last say but it's like an aging sportsman, replacing energy and attitude with guile and subtlety."

Until four years ago it was little known in its own right, its main purpose being as a key malt in Teacher 's. Then Ardmore Traditional was released, and it 's been winning over drinkers ever since. That malt is a delicatessen whisky: smoky, oily, and savory, a unique Highland malt with much to recommend it. This is a different proposition altogether. It 's clean and sweet, with pineapple candy, dusty and almost incense-like spices, and a liberal dose of sweet peat. Some citrus notes, too. The peat holds out until the end with impressive effect. There 's talk of this becoming a permanent part of the Ardmore portfolio. Let 's hope so: it 's further proof that Ardmore is a very interesting distillery indeed.

Whether you will like this whisky or not depends on whether you like woody whiskies with lots of sherry, and whether you care at all about recognizing the distillery character.

Ripe fallen fruit, chewy toffee, maple syrup, honey-glazed almonds, damp oak resins-it 's all there, and it 's all balanced and quite entertaining.

Ripe, heavy fruit dominate the palate-the sherry is very evident here, but it is not cloying. It 's quite nutty too, along with polished oak and toffee.

No. A Longrow with an attitude. Creamy, sweeter vanilla notes up front, with kiln smoke, sea-soaked stone, tar, anise, chocolate fudge, and apricot.

This, the most expensive, has been given some secondary maturation in Muscat wine casks. It 's the most complex of the trio, with more citric elements, hints of hay, and some spice, while the richness and dried scented fruit of the Muscat is a good accompaniment to the sloe-like side of the distillery character.

A sip made me nostalgic for childhood candies such as sherbet-filled, fizzy flying saucers and prohibited ivory-white candy sticks. I was seized by the initial lemon zing of acidic tartness, which becomes creamier before a richer, candied peel taste appears. There 's a clean, sweet finish and the mint pops up with water.

The whisky oozes syrupy vanilla, marshmallow, caramel, and marzipan, accentuated by coconut and other tropical fruits. Bruichladdich's signature freshness and brine emerges, but oh, so subtly. It finishes firmly dry and oaky, thanks to all those years in wood. Initially this helps to cut some of the sweetish viscosity of this whisky, but it lingers a bit too long for my palate.

No doubt this is partly due to its sweet underbelly of vanilla cream puff, honeyed barley, and melon fruit. The other factor is that the smoke influence is not medicinal like some other Islay whiskies, but rather more of a leafy bonfire smoke, with burning embers and teasing brine on the finish.

Peat reads more funky barnyard than smoke on the nose, with just a touch of sweetness behind it. The taste is much better than the smell, with the addition of smoke to the peat, intertwined with honey, salt, citrus, and ginger spice. The finish is slightly acidic and dry, far less satisfying than the mid-palate. There 's a reason why Dalmore doesn 't peat, but this release is still fascinating. (U.S. only)"

More of the same on the palate, with sweet notes to the fore, and virgin oak influence (wood shavings, polished leather, and a firm oak grip).

I have always felt that younger Glen Grant whiskies make a nice introduction to the single malt category-especially for a blend drinker trading up. The whisky is usually light to medium in body and uncomplicated-with no harsh edges to be particularly offensive. And so it is with this whisky. A soft, cereal grain maltiness marries nicely with floral, delicately fruity notes throughout. Gentle, dry but malty finish, with suggestions of shortbread cookies and vanilla. A nice representation of a younger Glen Grant. The flavors are clean and tight.

With a new visitor center, the gardens in full bloom, and the owners determined to make it a major player, things are looking up. This limited edition 170th anniversary bottling is made up of vintages stretching back to the 70s. They include a couple of sherry butts and some peated spirit. The result is a rich malt with some buttery toffee notes at first, distinctive lemon and green apple notes, and a touch of aniseed. Midway through, it sets off in a more feisty direction, with some peat, sharp spice, and green banana skin.

Truth be told, the aromas and flavors work well, but the lack of weight makes it feel like a tiddler rather than catch of the day. (Selected U.S. states, NZ, Switzerland)."

The palate is orange and malty, with cola, faint spices, and a little waxiness, but the core feels a little hollow. A good length finish where the pleasant buzz has a slight peatiness rubbed in.

Intense smoke on the nose and palate, with notes of freshly tarred road, cigar smoke and ash, licorice root, bacon fat, kalamata olive, and smoked seaweed. Struggling to emerge are youthful orchard fruit, honeyed malt, brine, and soft vanilla. Long, smoky finish -- like licking the walls of a peat-infused kiln. A very invigorating whisky. It 's a few years younger than the other ultra-peated whisky, Ardbeg Supernova. I think if they were both the same age, I would like them equally (and score them equally -- I gave Supernova an 89). But the Octomore does taste a little green, which was not noticeable in the Supernova. I think Octomore will be very good in another five years, and amazing in another ten.

Notes of vanilla, crÃ¨me brulee, marzipan, caramel-coated popcorn, brown sugar, toasted coconut, and subtle pineapple and papaya. A gentle dried spice finish rescues the whisky from all the sweetness.

The whisky is still youthful, but for a whisky of such youth it shows great balance, individuality, and promise. Notes of vanilla cream, honey, and fruit (pineapple, pear) are peppered with nuances of smoke, herbs, and pine. Youthful, vibrant finish.

Woven around it, there 's crÃ¨me caramel and heavier cinnamon flaring at the margins, softening with dilution, but remaining sweet. The first Midleton to carry master distiller Brian Nation 's name is purposeful and assured, lacking some of the sappiness of the 2013 release.

The nose comprises whole orange peel, boiled sugar, and dried peach pits. Sherbet, fruit polos, apple, baked almond slice, and digestive biscuit make for a sweet palate. For real street cred, Maggie needs more backbone: the thin mouthfeel needs more weight and structure. The finish is precipitously swift. Rather ordinary, though I wouldnÕt tell Maggie to her face."

Sweet caramel, smooth honey, zested mandarin, gentle wood spices, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, mango, guava, and papaya, with a finish of cereal notes and dried tropical fruits.

Multi-layered nose of fudge, vanilla, pecan cookies, soda bread, and Ice Breakers mints. Ethereal and soft array of creamy vanilla, pear, fruity hard candy, and greengage, before a groundswell of pepper, star anise, and clove. Evolving juicier, tropical fruit notes risk being swamped in spice. The dough, gingersnaps, and hot finish remind us it 's grain. Hyde? Go seek. (5,000 bottles)"

Similar in personality to Greenore 8 year old -- rather light and gently sweet -- but deeper, more oily in texture, not as crisp, with enhanced spice notes. You 'll also find soft creamy vanilla, lemon meringue, cut hay, orange rock candy, teasingly subtle bitter chocolate, and a dry, spicy finish. Whether you like the 8 or 15 year old depends on mood and time of day. I find them equally pleasant in personality."

It's a spring whisky, with much in common with Bladnoch in the Scottish Lowlands or peated Connemara from Ireland: sweet apple and pear flavors flit over wispy drying smoke. Sweden is represented by juniper, but there is blackcurrant, while cinnamon plays a role, too. Subtle, sweet, and sexy. Â£110"

Spice and fragrant oak on the nose, delicately floral, with light fruitiness on the palate and a hint of peat.

Lemon sherbet, cremola foam, and custard Danish start in a sweet direction, though it speedily converges prismatically to a trio of flavors comprising spearmint gum, menthol, and clove.

Initially this is quite hot and a little dumb, with whiffs of Indian spice - think turmeric and curry leaf - along with mint sauce (but no lamb) and a tickle of peat. The palate is quite intense and hot, with powdered almond, a grassy edge, and concentrated sweetness that starts in the center and builds toward the back palate.

This one has a vibrant, edgy opening, almost like a burning lawnmower box, mixed with needed oiliness (gun oil), white tea, and, in time, the rather pleasant note of a cold fish supper. The palate is broad, and though light, the oils allow it to cling to the tongue as the salt, lime, and smoke all begin to build. A little hard, but pleasantly bracing.Â£44"

The smoke as a result is diminished as are the grassy/bacony notes. While the smoke does emerge from its fruity bubble on the tongue, the effect is almost liqueur-like. It 's a very pleasing dram, but the question is, is it Caol Ila?"

The effect is of dried fish and seaweed, Brazil nut and bread basket. It needs water.

Deep mahogany color, with notes of toffee apples, waxed fruit, burnt orange, prunes in syrup, and dark chocolate. The intensity of the sherry and length of oak-aging gives the whisky a flavor profile that begins to transcend traditional whisky flavors, expressing notes of port wine, pot-still rum, and rancio.

Overall, it 's slightly unyielding, with toasted oak, hazelnut, and barley. Water opens up a sweeter core: Lucozade, apricot kernel, and barley. The palate is where the apricot flesh turns up, but then it firms up quickly, snuffing that moment of levity out. Water introduces lemon before it becomes very gingery on the finish.

It 's only three years old so don 't expect too much depth, but it 's a significant step up from the first release, it 's made by legendary former Laphroaig distiller Iain Henderson and it 's peated, so expect a treat. There 's not much happening on the nose, with some fluffy fruit masking a touch of charcoal smoke. But on the palate it goes through the gears, with melon and pear giving way to a wave of licorice before the peat kicks in and stays. It 's a bit like seeing a talented teenager try out for a sports team: lots of talent, no obvious weaknesses, but not yet big enough to front up to the first team, and in need of some muscle. Nevertheless, surprisingly balanced and rounded, and a sign of good things to come. (Selected British whisky outlets.)"

As a result, it 's rarely seen as a single malt, with even independent bottlings pretty thin on the ground.

This 21 year old is the color of old gold, and while the nose initially surprises with a hint of suet dumplings, there 's a rich and dangerously hedonistic sweetness behind, which is strangely hard to pin down. Coconut cream? Suntan lotion? Blackening butter in a frying pan? Eventually it appears to settle in the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e area, along with a fruity base (sweet, of course). There 's a light green note that suggests it might be distillery character coming through, but water suggests it 's new wood. 

In the mouth, there 's vanilla fudge and toffee, before a hint of muesli alongside dried mango. Overall it 's a bit like eating breakfast in a new ski chalet. Showy and impressive, but for me the wood 's in charge."

This isnÕt one of them. Longrow is an assertive whisky, and I can see the logic of finishing the whisky in an equally big Hungarian wine. The flavors are equal in intensity -- and this is certainly a dynamic whisky -- but they just donÕt integrate well. YouÕll find notes of waxed fruit, raisin, ripe barley, smoked fig, and toffee.

Pleasing enough, with lime jelly and kiwi fruits, and a little whiff of sweet oak, but itÕs very understated. In the mouth, it performs in a nutty way but doesnÕt seem to have moved much over its quarter of a century sequestration. There is some horchata and brazil nut, even a mashy note, but it either needs more time or a kick to get it moving. £70"

Nicely viscous on the palate, with similar notes as the aroma. But mid-palate the age gets the best of this whisky. The flavors flatten out and the wood dominates through the finish as the leather notes linger. ItÕs a rare treat to taste a whisky this old. If you like Lalique (and have the money), then this new bottling is worth some consideration, because there are certainly moments of intrigue and pleasure on the nose and beginning of the palate. But I have tasted several other 50-plus year old Macallans, and I can say with certainty that the 50 year old Millennium bottling and the 1946 vintage release were better and can probably still be found for a significantly lower price (Only 420 bottles available worldwide.)"

Think dried peels rather than raisin, then stir in some freshly-polished floor. The aromas are saturated and heavy - almost as if they are drifting towards you on humid air.

The palate shows light smoke and then a pleasant quinine bitterness mid-palate. This has the Japanese quality of laying flavors out very precisely on the tongue while also heightening their intensity. Water reduces the quinine effect, allowing the richness of the spirit to come through. Hanyu was a pretty big and firm (even rigid) whisky. Here that shell has cracked, allowing anise and blueberry to come through.

Perfectly weighted, right down to the ristretto finish with whole wheat digestive biscuits. Bold, audacious, and voluptuous."

The nose offers up allspice, moderate peat smoke, pomegranate, dried peel, and ground almonds. The palate is superb; milk chocolate caramels, assertive smoke, and peppercorn, then a slow, warm slide into coffee, cocoa, and licorice, becoming lush and velvety in texture. Paradoxically, the more diluted it becomes, the thicker and more substantial it seems to taste. Long finish of coffee and chocolate. (Batch 4)"

This single cask release is the second from the John Distilleries and a significant step upward. An altogether more complex whisky with an earthy, prickly peat at one level, and a rich pureed pear heart with orange fruit and berries.

The palate is a little slow to start with, offering a mix of spruce and pine, then those soft fruits carry you onward.

A traditionalist approach: direct fire, wooden washbacks, wild yeast, and worm tubs yield a single malt whisky that, though barely over the 3 year legal limit, is already complex: think barley sugar and apricot. The fire and the worms give the mid-palate some real weight (boding well for longer-term maturation), but the slow distillation has added floral notes that dance on top. Â£55"

This one is the most intense, with oily, charcoally peat most evident. But what makes this whisky particularly special is a dark chocolate and lime candy heart, the concentrated pear notes, and a refreshing sweet theme that holds off the oil and smoke elsewhere.

When Kavalan appeared at a precocious 42 months, it sat up and took notice. Owned by food and beverage conglomerate King Car, Kavalan started producing in 2006 with blender Ian Chang at the helm - and a hotline to consultant Dr. Jim Swan. Taiwan 's tropical climate pushes the maturation cycle along at a ferocious rate, but the key here is its complexity. Maybe it 's auto-suggestion, but I could swear there 's ginseng in here, as well as honeycomb and black cherry pie filling. Fresh and clean, the spirit is rich and accompanied with great wood.

I tasted it next to a couple of the other ''entry level'' straight rye whiskeys to confirm this isn't all just fancy packaging, and it is indeed a superior product. No, it's not one of those ultra-aged rye whiskeys on the market, but it wasn't meant to be either. A nice whiskey, but pricey for a rye with no age statement.

On the palate, chocolate becomes more a supporting flavor for classic bourbon notes of oak, maple, caramel, and clove spice. The mid-palate is a little acidic and the chocolate adds a slight bitterness to the equation. The finish is a little too dry, but in all, an intriguing combination of flavors."

Candy sweet, grainy, still simple, and a bit thin; increasingly hot at the end. Needs more breadth and depth, but there 's nothing seriously flawed. I 'd characterize this as a good flyweight boxer caught in a cruiserweight bout; nice footwork, solid performance, and dealing some good hits, but the bigger, older bourbons give it a palate-pounding. Price is per 375 ml."
4649,Teerenpeli,,,43.00%,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,84,87,Single Malt Finnish Whisky,FI,8082.0,"Beautiful little bottle and label. 100% rye, aged 2 years in 53-gallon heavy char oak barrels. Smells right: rye spice, orange candies, and oaky vanilla. Light body, quite hot, and the sweetness comes through, but the rye really turns it up as the liquid spreads on the tongue and warms. Some plastic hints high in the mouth. Promising, but not there yet; part of the problem with big barrels."
4655,Michel Couvreur,,10 year old,45.00%,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,83,58,Unspecified Single Malt,UK,8088.0,"Grassy notes and damp hay define the aroma of this young bourbon, while the palate offers good citrus and orchard fruits. However, there is a varnish note and stalky green character that hold it back. Needs time."
4659,Woodford Reserve,,,45.20%,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,83,100,Single Malt American Whiskey,US,8105.0,"As mentioned in my column this issue, Stillhouse is packaged in a stainless steel can, much like the ones used for paint thinner. Labeled ""100% corn whiskey."" Clean scent of corn, green corn stalks, and apples. Very similar on the tongue, with just a hint of burn. For what it is, this is not bad; clean, tasty, definitely a good mixer. They have several flavored versions as well. Sourced whiskey."
4744,Mackmyra,,,46.10%,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,83,64,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,SE,8236.0,"Showing its youth through an obvious green character that peers from beneath a cloak of campfire and applewood smoke, with banana as the prominent fruit, along with secondary apple, citrus, and a peculiar rubber tire note. The palate is light-bodied and overtly sweet, with grass, marshmallow, and vanilla. Reminiscent of a Lowland malt, which only contributes to the disjointed feeling of the whole package."
