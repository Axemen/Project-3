walker blue signature bears no age statement but i m told that a 27 year old aberfeldy is the heart of the blend the first release consists only of 1000 individually numbered bottles and they re only available in new york city i m always a little skeptical of very expensive blends that come in fancy packages there are some very good reasonably priced blends in the 10-20 year old range and the expensive ones are often only marginally better if that but i like this whisky a whole lot better than the standard dewar s white label and it is also superior to dewar s 12 year old-a whisky which i find to be quite enjoyable while maintaining the dewar s profile-nicely balanced-this whisky offers greater depth maturity and complexity without being too woody-a creamy malty foundation makes sure of that the whisky expresses a rich honeyed maltiness which combines nicely with notes of golden raisins vanilla caramel and crã¨me brã»lã©e with just a hint of spicy oak notes for complexity signature is a different style when compared to johnnie walker blue-it s more elegant and bashful-but like blue i put signature on my short list of the finest blends on the market \r\n",

      "when the malts from both distilleries are good though - and the official bottlings tend to be - they re very very good this clynelish is a delightful surprise from the beginning its nose some

attractive with savory peat sweet pineapple salt light fish drizzled lemon pepper chili and cardamom it all makes for a big complex evolving and grown up whisky - and great value for the price tag the

into the clove cassia and allspice area than just dried fruit while maturity is obvious and there s even a hint of dunnageleatheriness it is the concentrated fruit sweetness that surprises here the distillery has fought back against the cask and while still crepuscular in nature there is a rich concentrated and mellow glow at its heart â£345 only 60 bottles have been released from this 60 year old first-fill sherry cask amazingly the nose is not dominated by wood but is mature and concentrated with the aroma of rain-moistened tweed tropical fruit blonde tobacco cedar and chanterelle

s 1976 vintage which i had a hand in selecting but ironically don t like as much this new vintage approaches the caliber of the 1973 vintage release from two years ago which i still think is the best

peaches coconut floral notes and a hint of almonds medium-full in body and firm on the palate the flavors are complex and exhibit the same notes as the aroma starting out gently sweet but gradually

delicately caramelized pineapple creamy caramel crã¨me brã»lã©e anise and subtle toasted marshmallow add complexity as does its gently spicy pleasingly dry finish two years older than the standard 16 year old nadurra which i like for its vibrancy and freshness this new triumph 1991 is richer and more textured with more caramelized sugars riper barley and greater fruit impact more mouth-coating too exclusive to the us a vatting of three first-fill american oak casks for me this is the most lifted and effusive of the ongoing cellar collection range the nose is full of aromas of anise blackcurrant leaf honeysuckle jasmine frangipani flowers and a subtle almond sweetness the palate continues in similar vein with more spice and just sufficient oak to add distinct structure and a coconut character sublime it won t however be released in the us â£1000 quite deep for a glenmorangie but still surprisingly balanced glenmorangie is a lighter-style spirit and in the past some of the older vintage expressions were heavy-handed on the wood the oak aging is obvious on the nose but this whisky manages to walk the thin line between enjoying the maturity and depth of an older whisky without too much oak influence the 8th private edition release this one is finished in sun-baked casks which previously contained malmsey madeira a predominantly sweet and fruity whisky with caramel honeyed almonds peaches in syrup and orange scone soft soothing finish delicious the third release in glenmorangie s bond house no1 collection spent 10 years in bourbon casks before being transferred into bual

      " pale white wine color smoky youthful aroma there s no surprises here-it definitely smells like a young ardbeg big beautiful explosion of smoky tarry flavors that evolve and seem to linger on the palate indefinitely this is the first ardbeg release ive tasted since the distillerys long shut down in the 1980s after the shut down they discontinued their floor maltings so i was concerned that it might not taste like the ardbeg of old ardbeg fans can let out a big sigh of relief this one is big and gutsy-just the way we like it my only criticism of this particular release is that it could have used about one or two more years in oak to tame some of the spirity nature of the whisky otherwise this is wonderful stuff very dynamic complex and powerful here s what i m picking up in somewhat descending order in taste profile leafy smoke coal tar mocha fudge with dark chocolate chips smoked olive peppered seaweed salad fruit lemon lime genever brine-tinged grass and with some coaxing floral notes violet? compared to last year s debut release of supernova this one is certainly comparable but i feel it s a tad richer with more leafy smoke and ripe barley it also seems a bit more polished less aggressive i like it a little more than its predecessor rated 89 ardbeg in perpetuum would mean ardbeg forever it s made up of a mã©lange of different casks american oak refill french oakâ¦and others intense marine with pineapple wet moss tar cracked black pepper and a nuttiness the palate is oily sweet with smoked cream balanced by a very pure acidity then soot and char will the fact that it isn t an extreme ardbeg satisfy everyone? probably not is it a bloody good session drink? damn right it is 200th anniversary bottling distilled in the spring of 1996 this was matured in bourbon barrels and yields a nose of exotic spices heather in bloom soft aromatic peat and grapefruit sprinkled with iodine well-mannered peat brine orange peel vanilla and black pepper on the palate the finish is long smoky and peppery the oldest ardmore i have tasted smartly bottled at cask strength and not chill-filtered the entry level ardmore traditional is at the opposite end of the age spectrum tasting quite youthful my initial concern with this 30 year old was would the wood dominate the lovely floral smoky notes i enjoy so much with ardmore? the wood is certainly present but the smoke still comes through there s a gently layered sweetness that complements the smoke toffee deep caramel subtle honey licorice root bourbon barrel char coffee grounds and high cocoa chocolate with subtle dried citrus and a suggestion of floral soap dry finish with more bourbon barrel char and licorice root considering that ardmore has historically been a blending malt most of the stocks right now are much younger this is a rare treat it s a wee bit thin in body and a little on the dry side from 30 years on wood for me to rate it in the mid 90s but it s still a very enjoyable whisky this is not a single-cask bottling like other recent wine-finished releases but the casks they selected are very good ones lovely antique amber color the madeira dovetails beautifully with the malt and oak and it has matured nicely for a whisky less than ten years old lush notes of orange marmalade raspberry tart and panforte all wrapped up in rich toffee and a dusting of nutmeg cinnamon and cocoa a dry resinous spicy tactile finish adds balance complexity and additional dimension smartly bottled at a higher strength some of these wine-finished arran whiskies are impressive this is one of them aged in first and mostly second fill sherry casks the sherry is kept in balance and does not mask auchentoshan s subtle beauty the classic auchentoshan creamy grassy freshness abounds complemented by honey-soaked almonds cereal grain and an array of bright fruit citrus sultana mandarin not as polished as the auchentoshan 21 year old but quite entertaining 420 bottles for the us amber color with gold hues soft subtly seductive aromas of creamy vanilla crã¨me brulee tropical fruit oak and a hint of mint light to medium in body-silky in texture at first then becoming and firm on the palate the whisky starts out gently sweet with creamy vanilla and honeyed malt subtle tropical fruit notes arrive mid palate the whisky then begins to dry out fairly rapidly this is a 36 year old lowland after all as dry resinous notes of vanilla mint and herbs reveal themselves the whisky finishes dry with notes of soft leather the way the owners of auchentoshan and glen garioch are handling vintage bottlings now is that specialty retailer orders an entire cask and sells it exclusively this one is a sams exclusive its older than the previous widely distributed 1966 bottling and less expensive too you wouldnt expect a triple distilled lowland whisky to age so gracefully auchentoshan is an exception to the rule it has acquired the depth and maturity from extensive aging yet it still manages to maintain its distillery character and lowland gentility only on the dry finish does it really show its age but thats a small price to pay for an otherwise very good single cask whisky at a very reasonable price for 36 years old a special balvenie to honor master distiller david stewart s 30 years working at the distillery this is a big and brooding dram the aroma suggests it is aged in both bourbon and sherry oak it s complex and richly flavored sweeter up front and increasingly dry towards its finish with notes of honey candied fruit thick cut marmalade vanilla almonds and prominent spicy oak notes i m picking up plenty of sherry in this new expression which i like it finishes firmly dry with notes of spice and tannin while i enjoy this whisky a great deal you might want to seek out the balvenie 25 year old which i rated a 93 while the odd bottle is still available it is slightly more rounded on the palate and less than half the cost a harmonious marriage of fruit and spice more balanced than last year s sweet rum cask release in fact this is one of the most deftly-balanced whiskies i ve tasted this year bramble ripe nectarine caramel apple honeyed vanilla and golden raisin spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg soft for balvenie lingering warm dried spice finish so soon? this latest release of what is becoming a legendary series mixes nine casksâfour butts five hoggiesâfrom between 1966 and 1990 hugely complex and obviously mature it is one to sit and smell forever marzipan mocha pain au chocolat manuka honey every sniff reveals another aroma it opens into cigar sandalwood citrus and ripe black fruits the palate is equally layered and expansive it takes water but only a drop for that density is all-important this latest installment of the tun 1401 series is a classic expression of old mature balvenie where a waxiness akin to furniture polish slides into mead-like aromas actually more like metheglin as there s an herbal spiced element its textural richness means it is best with water on the side allowing deep earthy licorice and cigar ash tones to develop along with just the lightest squeeze of tannin us only the oldest of the set shows a shift into a sense of calm and quietude the dried blossoms of youth are there still with a little color to them while a curl of smoke also comes through then out of nowhere a sudden eruption of tropical fruits a flaring in the dying light there s no oakiness just a distillery framed gently receding a remarkable dram it s almost shameful to discuss cost â£19000 a refill american oak

medicinal laphroaig when compared to some of its siblings will you prefer the new 18 year old to the 15 year old it is replacing? that depends i enjoy the balance and subtle complexity of flavors with the 15 year old but i also like the enhanced richness and mouth-coating creaminess of the 18 the higher strength and no chill-filtering of the 18 is certainly a bonus side note i know this is a moot point now but i would like to have seen the 15 year old bottled at 48% rather than 43% similar to laphroaig quarter cask but also finished in oloroso sherry casks fruit and smoke fleshy red berries red licorice toffee ripe barley coal tar sun-baked seaweed peat smoke and a hint of coffee grounds tarry finish i rated the quarter cask a 91 and i think this whisky is similar in quality if you like sherry-influenced whiskies then go for the triple wood if not then consider the quarter cask travel retail and european exclusive a very special anniversary bottling this is old-style brooding laphroaig fully mature and rich it shows that classic roiling mass of kelp oil and brine always balanced by sweetness in this case autumn berry fruits malt adds a crunchiness the palate is gentle and

mouth-coatingly rich and intense whisky the malts pack down together like a rugby scrum and combine with impressive intensity â¬36 does it do exactly what it says on the tin? you betcha this is big

theres gooseberry spearmint and apple pip but as youd expect the peat lingers so which independent bottler comes out in the big battle of the islay blended malts? given this is bottled at a lower

a long acidic slightly sour dry and spicy finish rounds out a unique and intriguing whisky us only dry peats tossed on a driftwood fire with coastal aromas of sun-scorched seaweed beside high tide rock pools comprise this refined dram a momentary glimpse of lighter lemon lime and pineapple is quickly snuffed out by the full strength assault it s like pulling the pin on a grenade there s a dense barrage of peat moss worn leather and cocoa at the death ride through it to glory possibly the highest abv that compass box has ever given usâ â£120 this radiant refreshing whisky offers creamy fudge light vanilla fresh apple peach and biscuit notes on the nose demonstrating the generosity of the american oak in the mouth it s luscious balanced and mouth-coating with sweet honey lemon peel lime zest and aromatic spices fattening out briefly before becoming soft as suede riffing on vanilla melon and lemon biscuits dry finish with vanilla cream and soft fruits finishing these malts in first-fill oloroso casks helps produce a tempting nose of tangy marmalade cherry chocolate sponge malt and apple tart with a rub of spice chocolate spiced orange pepper and ginger notes before sweet toffee breaks through allowing the orange peel-rich marmalade to mingle with the malt it s a big mouthful and definitely one to try matthew gloag introduced this classic blend in 1896 and now kirsteen campbell master blender of grouse since 2016 is taking it to new heights rich toffee boundless baked orange notes wood spices dried banana chips and some sweet floral top notes very smooth drinking

chocolate desserts dry smoke ginger pepper and dark chocolate to finish heather honey sultry smoke sherry and spice make this the ideal hibernation libation help see off the darkest months with these dominant orange notes and a supporting cast of crystalized ginger cinnamon and nutmeg a warming taste of red berries gingerbread and christmas spices gives the underside of the tongue a roasting before melting away leaving a creamy mouthfeel imbued with strands of subtle smoke barrel char and spiced orange just as complex as johnnie walker gold but fuller and more richly textured not surprising given that there are no grain whiskies in johnnie walker green this is one of the finer vatted malts on the market its flavors are well-integrated you ll find creamy toffee and nougat at its core which is then layered with notes of vanilla mint fresh brine and even a hint of mustard seed excitingly fresh and vibrant on the finish a whisky for both the blend and single malt drinker and at $55 it is also fairly valued for an all-malt whisky a zeitgeist johnnie walker fine-tuned for the american palate this blend has a moreish nose of cinnamon cocoa and the toasted coconut of macaroons mingled with strands of smoke dried walnut nutmeg and an array of spicy rye anchored by a concentrated line of vanilla lots of american oak at play here it s elegant dry and smooth with vanilla cinnamon coconut and flashes of spice it s fabulous sipped straight up but keep walking to the finish value pick blender aimã©e gibson s experimental batch 7 is designed as a sherry finished

only this whisky is slowly making its way around the world but it was worth the wait as master blender colin scott s use of mizunara oak makes for an impressively different nose from chivas regal 12

banana-topped banoffee pie fudge vanilla sandwich cookies barley sugar and lemon peel with hardly any spice in the early phase the finish has a snag of pepper at the end but this is gorgeously tasty

filtered and bottled at cask strength this edition is very rich with dark berry notes on the nose hazelnuts caramel cinnamon and orange fondant creams the palate is full and supple with polished oak honey new leather raisins prunes and a hint of cloves very long in the finish with plain chocolate black pepper fruity spices and oak identifiably richer fuller and smokier on the nose when compared to other young ardbegs while still prominent there s slightly less brine and seaweed more earthiness tar soot espresso tobacco grass and chocolate fudge the same goes for the palate it starts out like a slightly more gutsy than normal cask strength young ardbeg eg renaissance and if you go into this experience expecting to be totally blown away by peat tar and smoke you might feel a bit under-challenged initially but the peat eventually builds to a powerful lava-like crescendo and you realize that this is no ordinary ardbeg the length of the finish is seemingly endless bold and warming through all this there s a soft underbelly of ripe barley and a vanilla sweetness to balance at least some of the tar heat and smoke -- something i admire in many ardbegs bottom line it s an interesting entertaining and eye-opening experience i like how mature it tastes for a relatively young whisky but like a whisky that shows just a bit too much sherry or oak i think the extra peat to a degree masks the subtle complexities i admire in some other lesser-peated ardbegs which is the only thing keeping me from scoring this whisky in the 90s all smoky whisky enthusiasts should endeavor to try this at least once deep gold color very bold aroma of toffee dark chocolate diesel fuel-soaked soil smoldering campfire coal tar clove leather fig and dark berried fruit more of the same on the palate with seaweed smoked haddock and cough drops emerging towards the finish this whisky is very dynamic and exciting to drink my only criticism it comes across a little green on the finish which keeps me from scoring it in the 90s still it s pretty impressive considering how young some of the whiskies in it are if you like your islay whiskies young and brooding this one s for you let it be known that from now on june 2nd will be ardbeg day that s fine by me as annually we can enjoy delights such as this bold expression that belts you in the nose with coal tar and soot before bay rum emerges lightening slightly into lime and hot green bracken the palate is oily sweet and very deep a growly bugger that lurches toward the shore and then spins back to the laurel bushes inland 13000 bottles a touch of damp dunnage some ardbeggian soot and plenty of jalapeã±o-style heat shows maturity and depth of character with just-dead bonfire ointment and a sweetness which here is like honeycomb water makes it bolder with deeper smoke while the palate has sweet wood balanced cigar-accented smoke and layers of salt angelica and plumâ â£90500 ml not an unpeated ardbeg but a new initiative to raise money for the kildalton project which supports community projects in south islay smoke but also real sweetness hothouse peaches mezcal smoked oyster sphagnum moss a huge hit of vetiver and coal tar the smoke flies to the throat before fogging forward while the sweet core with added raspberry and cream and mint moves to the back a worthwhile dram and a hugely worthwhile cause buy for either reason or bothâ â£120 distilled at a time when the future of the distillery looked bleak it is non-chill filtered and mildly herbal on the nose with soft peat muted iodine and a sprinkling of pepper plus warm leather the palate is initially peppery then vanilla and green apples emerge along with aniseed and rich peat peppery to the end with a hint of iodine and coal smoke

tangerine nice viscosity with good grip on the finish i really like the balance and complexity of this whisky a very solid effort and the price is right the follow-up and older sibling to curiositas i ve been pushing for speyside distilleries to bump up the peating levels of their malt they use for a long time because a majority of the spirits are big enough to handle the peat smoke and this whisky proves my point the tarry peat smoke and bacon-like notes are a delight and they are balanced nicely by a honey and apple pie sweetness spanish olives in brine dark chocolate golden raisin and subtle spice round out the palate nicely not a heavy whisky but pretty powerful stuff for benriach so nice of the previous owners of this distillery to experiment with higher peating levels decades ago a heavily peated benriach that has been finished in a tawny port pipe the nose is akin to cherries sloes and blueberries soaked in alcohol the peatiness manifests itself as a smoky herbal note and shows most on the palate but is never too dominant an oil of clove coolness takes control on the finish great balance and integration a finish that genuinely works â£53 remember those remarkable 20+ year old benriachs that appeared when the distillery reopened which we thought were gone forever? think again this new and keenly priced arrival has sweet malt on the nose followed by mango orange blossom honey and portuguese custard tarts it needs a little water to calm the alcohol and help to spread an already thick texture along the tongue a sweetly spicy and creamy hit toward the end marked within

sweet sherry honey and contrasting lemon juice and pepper the finish is lengthy but dries rapidly with lively pepper oak tannins and a final fatty noteâ â£350 if cragganmore is sometimes overlooked then what of this poor lowlander whose qualities are consistently overlooked? again here we have a pale color suggesting use of refill casks but whereas cragganmore was reticent to the point of being mute this is expressive and lively the nose with intense floral notes of lilac blossom freesia and chamomile is a revelation these are backed with a thick unsalted butter note that suggests that the cask might not have been as quiet as first imagined give it time and out come boiled sweets and a fresh green note like a just-whittled stick a hint of wheat chaff and fragrant grasses brings to mind lying in a summer meadow watching the dust motes dance in the sunshine the mouth is sweet and lemon-accented with a pickup of a pleasant chalkiness on the nose that gives it the suggestion of a fino sherry or vin jaune i like its energy and feel that the addition of water reduces its vibrancy so for drinking purposes i d have a glass of ice cold water on the side all in all impressive with just a hint of soap on the finish taking it below the 90 mark style speyside single malt scotch color amber aroma rich and rather full for glenlivet with nuts and fruit drenched with layers of toffee and caramel palate rich and enveloping-almost chewy-with notes of toffee and caramel up front delicate fruit nuts and spice emerge mid-palate adding complexity becoming dry with a long spicy finish very stylish quite refined too with notes of vanilla peaches and flowering currant the whisky is very soft on the palate delicate and almost bashful at times indeed it may take a couple of dates with this whisky for it to fully to reveal itself the whisky finishes toasty with a pleasing cereal grain maltiness some whiskies are great after dinner others make wonderful pre-dinner drams this one is great anytime new packaging and new whisky too-sort of according to glenlivet s whisky maker jim cryle archive is now being bottled in smaller batches allowing them to be more selective in the casks used to improve its quality and flavor i believe that it has worked it tastes more refined along with archive s signature creamy toffee notes i m picking up beautiful floral vanilla and fruity notes peaches pineapple coconut on the nose and palate with subtler nutty anise threads throughout an elegant expression of glenlivet lovely bouquet of dried citrus fruit honeyed apricot and plum complemented by exotic wood spice malty vanilla and a hint of mint and anise similar follow-through on the palate with the sweeter notes up front full fruit impact mid-palate leading to a dry peppery exotic wood spice finish the whisky evolves on the palate and is very impressive with its only blemish being a bit too dry and oaky on the finish this whisky fits the profile of other extra-matured glenlivet whiskies i ve tasted notes of coconut and other assorted tropical fruit old rum caramel custard shortbread cookies vanilla malt and a hint of cotton candy this is all balanced by polished oak a soothing rather sweet whisky which is quite surprising for its age for those of you drinking whisky long enough it was a glenmorangie tain l hermitage 1978 vintage that kick-started this whole exotic finish trend by glenmorangie about 10 years ago that one wasn t sold here in the us but this one is although this one costs about four times as much as the original one did when it was released both were racked in used bourbon barrels before being finished in hermitage red wine casks from northern rhone the best of these limited release glenmorangies like the fino sherry finish expression several years ago add complexity and intrigue without masking glenmorangie s lovely subtle complexity this one does a pretty good job of it although there s a lot of fruit here an obvious contribution of the wine complex fruit with notes of plum raspberry nectarine blueberries and a hint of lemon underneath the fruit there s nougat dark chocolate and cocoa towards the finish the whisky becomes nicely dry with oak lingering on the palate finished extra-matured as they are now saying in sauternes casks this expression replaces the madeira wood finish beautiful sweet notes of honeycomb sultana apple pie and white chocolate balanced by peach coconut and pineapple gentle background spice the sauternes cask adds extra weight and viscosity the sweetness is not cloying nor does it dominate the flavor profile a good demonstration of the benefits of wood finishing milsean is the latest private edition release from glenmorangie after initial bourbon barrel maturation the whisky spent several years in heavily-toasted portuguese red wine casks fresh fruits on the early nose with ginger and a hint of musk coconut and icing sugar emerge smooth and rounded on the palate with a big fruit hit that becomes more citric in time plus lively oak spices lingering in the finish with persistent spice finally plain chocolate and chili the ninth release in glenmorangie s private edition series was matured fully in american oak barrels that previously contained rye whiskey a reticent early nose melon and a hint of lemon then warm oily cereal notes and honey develop initially fruity on the palate

extremely rare range and has been matured in bourbon casks for 15 years before a third is transferred toâ olorosoâ sherry casks for 3 years dried fruits icing sugar honey lemon cheesecake and floral aromas on the nutty nose the palate offers figs crã¨me brã»lã©e cinnamon more honey and citrus fruit the finish sees citrus fruit and oak merge nicely its nice to see gordon & macphail bottlings at strengths higher than 40% and it makes this already hefty whisky even more so it is fragrant with subtle heather notes rich and malty and quite thick in texture with notes of honey and vanilla interwoven fruit sultana along with subtle lemon and orange add complexity all this sweetness is rounded out nicely with a long dry oakyspicy finish a delicious evolving whisky bottled exclusively for binnys beverage depot interestingly this whisky was bottled in 2005 but not released until the end of 2008 the brand manager tells me that they wanted to wait until the stocks of the current 1980s

the 18 year old while showing maturity found in the 25 year old the lack of chill-filtering enhances the whisky s vibrancy and like all the benromachs it s mouth-coatingly thick and malty \r\n",
      " the first 10 year old release containing whisky produced entirely by the new owners i love the interplay here between the malt sherry and smoke with all getting a chance to shine a rich vanilla-tinged malty foundation deep caramel rhum agricole an array of lush fruit and dark chocolate along with grassyhay notes honeysuckle subtle spice cinnamon anise and lingering earthy smoke a vast improvement from the origins release last year i would only make three changes to make this whisky even better and elevate it to 90+ status a couple more years on oak bottling at 46% and not chill-filtering it still this is one of the best efforts from this distillery well done\r\n",
      " another example of the old strathspey  style of whisky which predates the lighter more esteryfloral style we have become accustomed to here distillery weight and time work in tandem to give a nose that has slightly overripe orchard fruits smoke and seville orange the palate then heads into the hedgerowsâhawthorn and currant jamâbefore a waxiness emerges the finish reveals a mix of smoke and mint all in all an excellent dram â£425 gold color citrus zest aromas and creamy sweet notes-reminiscent of lemon meringue pie-with subtle tropical fruit and marshmallow notes dancing throughout this whisky has great balance and is fully mature at 12 yrs which should be no surprise for a lowland whisky the palate delivers what the aroma promises with a touch of honey up front citrus and vanilla in the middle and a delicate dryness on the finishâ ive always admired bladnoch-a whisky that needs to be better known-and this expression reinforces my opinion distilled in scotland s most southerly distillery of bladnoch in october 1992 this bottling has been matured in a refill hogshead and 150 bottles have been allocated to the us it presents a fresh nose with initial herbal notes turning to cornflakes and newly-mown hay sweet and fruity on the palate with oat biscuits and milk chocolate the finish is relatively short with spicy custard then a final fruit flourish the revival of bladnoch distillery in southwest scotland continues with the launch of 15 and 25 year old expressions to add to the nas samsara reviewed winter 2016 talia has been finished in new american oak casks sweet and floral on the nose with violets jaffa orange and fragrant fresh oak medium to full-bodied with rich fruit notes praline malt and finally raisins and prunes dark oak in the long mouth-drying finish the first tempest to be imported to the us aged exclusively in first-fill bourbon casks with the bourbon cask and relatively young age you can really feel all the islay love bracing with plenty of sea character along with honeyed vanilla citrus floral notes especially lavender rumbling peat smoke tobacco and resinous oak on the finish a bit steep in price for a 10 year old but very dynamic a sweet start then a sudden blast of fresh menthol-like toothpaste pleasant before it dips into slightly decaying soft fruits again nice a mashy note then violet-accented smoke water adds some elegance and weight this sweetness continues on the palate where there s toffee raisin ripe fruits and slow-burning peatiness fully integrated and ember-like on the back palate the finish is all hot peppered mackerel recommended us only port cask is the third and final release in bowmore s vintner s trilogy it was matured for 13 years in bourbon barrels then 14 years in port pipes woodsmoke and blackcurrant on the mildly medicinal nose with developing sea salt and vanilla fudge smoky dried fruit on the palate with a hint of brine old oak antiseptic and black pepper in the finish pale goldstraw color fresh appetizing aroma and flavor of brine delicate peat gentle sweetness and a touch of spice and seaweed medium in body and slightly oily in texture nicely balanced and clean with a salty dryish finish this is a lovely very appetizing expression of a distillery that has been closed and dismantled it was the original clynelish distillery it is a very nice example of a northern highland whisky and expresses a great balance between sweetness and brine youth and maturity however i would have liked to have seen it bottled at a higher strength part of an ongoing series and the first appearance of port charlotte this ain t shy assertive with banana roasted red pepper paprika and a hit of barbecued pork glazed with pomegranate molasses the palate has blazing heat but also oiliness and real density the peat doesn t so much rumble as sit there in a cloud opaque impenetrable even water cannot unlock it rooty and tarry this is not a dram for the fainthearted â£65 500 ml peated whiskies definitely have a dropping off point where they become too old and tired and the nose for this one would indicate it s past its prime with gravel rubbery smoke and raisin on the palate it s a different story as ashy smoke combines with raisin and rancio turning the peat age detriment into an asset strangely alluring it s like sitting on a park bench next to a weathered old man who ends up having a real tale to tellâ  us only dried peat smoke a papery column of cigar ash sizzling bacon fat baked earth and a shower of sea spray coupled with hints of fresh peach and ripe fruits the palate has a light oily consistency ingrained with smokiness throughout tasting of vanilla toffee pick n  mix foam bananas tangy citrus and sweet tropical fruits the whole arrangement given a peppery lift before succumbing to a late nuttiness it s not named after the gaelic for smoky for nothing you know this was matured in second-fill sherry casks and then spent 3 years in first-fill pedro ximã©nez butts the nose features fruit and nutty milk chocolate fudge sultanas and mixed candied peel lush sweet sherry on the palate with a carryover of fudge and sultanas from the nose long in the nutty spicy finish which offers nutmeg and peppery oak 5000 bottles like the clynelish 14 year old also reviewed in this issue it is nice to see diageo finally introduce official distillery bottlings of caol ila here in the us after being available in the uk for many years now my suitcases were getting quite heaving on my return trips from scotland this is a splendid coal ila it is wonderfully vibrant understandably the immediate impact on the palate is the peat smoke but theres so much else going on here too smoked olives seaweed salt and pepper all placed on a gently sweet bed of toffee and vanilla fudge lingering smoke olives and seaweed on the finish amber gold color an exciting aroma-classic islay it is very phenolic reminiscent of standing downwind of a peat kiln interwoven spice especially pepper seaweed and sweet & sour notes add complexity light to medium in body but quite oily nicely balanced flavors of peat smoke seaweed salt & pepper all wrapped up in a gentle sweetness lingering peat smoke and spice on the finish yet another example of caol ilas fine pedigree this bottling has great balance and i especially enjoy how the smoke and sweetness marry together my only criticism is that it is a bit soft for caol ila i would love to try this whisky at 46 or 50% abv which would give it a bit more guts a rounded and mature affair the 25 years in oak has made it a bit more refined and drier on the palate compared to younger expressions all the classic caol ila notes are stillthere-mustard seaweed olives damp peat salt and pepper a touch of vanilla wafer anise smoked almonds and tarry rope add complexity those of you who prefer ardbeg 17 over the 10 and laphroaig 15 over the 10 will be attracted to this whisky when compared to caol ilas younger siblings but at $225 its an expensive date isnt it? bottled in 2004 and still in circulation a very traditional caol ila not a heavy-bodied whisky but it throws a strong punch notes of tarry rope infused with seaweed and brine all on an oily malty vanilla foundation throw in some orchard fruit manzanilla olive black licorice stick and soot with brine and tellicherry pepper on the finish clean fun and dynamic\r\n",
      " caol ila makes unpeated whisky for blenders but it rarely gets bottled as a single malt here s a very revealing opportunity to find out what caol ila tastes like without the smoke good viscosity and rather sweet showing thick honeyed vanilla gobs of fruit lemon drops lime tart ripe bartlett pear kiwi mint jelly and cut grass its sea influence finally emerges towards the finish with brine and just a hint of seaweed bruichladdich and bunnahabhain are now bottling peated whiskies and caol ila does just the opposite this is an interesting diversion but i am missing the added dimension of peat smoke in this caol ila\r\n",
      " this is to be a permanent addition to the core caol ila range but it will raise a few eyebrows completely ignoring the current peat battle between ardbeg and bruichladdich and heading off into an altogether more refined and delicate direction this is a dignified and complex malt which doesn t give everything up immediately there s soft pear and guava on the nose and the trademark oiliness and distinctive peat are there but there s a buttery quality too as well as some brine and spice apple pip and traces of aniseed you get a sense of its age late on with some oaky tannins and sharper spice but overall this is an unhurried complex and sweet whisky with just enough peat to keep it honest very impressive limited general releases excluding the us unusual insofar as this is the one chance a year that drinkers get to try caol ila s other expression the unpeated version which - and here s a bit of history for you - helped save the distillery during the lean period of the whisky loch in the early 80s rather than this just being caol ila with the peat stripped out the team made it in a different fashion - but there are still hints of commonality \r\n",
      "for example the grassy note that usually lies beneath the smoke is the lead aroma here and it s not any old grass but wet grass - like skidding on a football soccer field the mind keeps looking for smoke but apart from a hint of birch smoke which could come from the refill cask it s whistle-clean and fruity and with a touch of water fills with an aroma of toffee popcorn custard and pears \r\n",
      "the palate continues in this light fashion with melon balls and fruit cocktail this potentially bland fleshiness is given a perkiness thanks to the high alcohol and again a jag of acidity bizarrely on the finish i pick up slight saltiness a fun dram this unpeated version of caol ila was matured in refill american oak hogsheads the nose is quite reticent with subtle vanilla and milk chocolate notes big fizzy-sweet fruit notes on the palate with caramel rock pools hot spices plain chocolate and very mild wood smoke bubble gum and peppery chocolate in the medium-length finish caperdonich is always a challenge to find this one is aged in a sherry cask one would fear that slumbering away for 35 years in a sherry cask would completely dominate this whisky s profile not this whisky as you would expect it is nicely matured but it is surprisingly clean and well rounded too exotic notes of dried fruits sultana subtle but viscous honey sandalwood and a potpourri of spice especially cinnamon anise ginger clean subtly spicy finish slowly sip and savor its delicate pleasures \r\n",

contrasting marine note in the background unctuous and rich on the palate with soft fruit almonds brittle toffee and lots of spice the finish is lengthy and earthy with caramel and vanilla notes ultimately being superseded by oak and sea saltâ â£60 a robust speysider - and very tactile too clinging to the palate but with no excessive oak vanilla and some dark chocolate notes along with coating yet ironically dry-ish honey notes but its biggest flavor note is citrus - particularly lemon along with some tangerine and a hint of pineapple - which helps to cut through the thickness good depth with dried spice polished oak and a wisp of smoke on the finish bottled in 2004 but only recently released to the us these days the mighty mortlach is a known quantity but diageo s two other meaty sitesâbenrinnes and dailuaineâremain in the shadows this is big boisterous and sherried but there s less of the gravy-browning elements you get from the other two at dailuaine it is fruit that is promoted alongside seville orange treacle and the inevitable raisin and date there are nods to px sherry as well every bit as good as mortlach â£43 master blender sandy hyslop has deliberately attempted to capture christmas in the glass and so it should come as no surprise to find a rich full and flavorsome whisky with sherry trifle red berries orange fruit and mince pie filling in the mix its put together with grace and style mixes well and is that rare beast - a blend that can be enjoyed on its own up close this displays more sherry and dried fruits particularly raisins currants and sultanas with a deep strawberry note and dollop of marmalade quite pungent and that resonates rewardingly at the back of the throat the juicy mandarin flavor has some tartness but then there s cake mix gingersnaps clove and toasted spices though it gravitates back to the marmalade the finish has dry bitter orange ginger and spice with a hint of lime zest confident and characterful baked almond desserts liberally splashed with cream light caramel malted milk and an invading cloud of smoke from newly ignited twigs a lucky strike from a forest survivalist on the palate it is soft and blushing with marmalade and warm butter ground ginger moving to chocolate orange toffee and ovaltine a whirl of spices and chunky chocolate round off this blend s finish stylishly this has all the hallmarks of a perfect nightcap very typical of old grain whiskies light in body and floral with soothing vanilla and a mã©lange of tropical fruit mandarin in syrup honey-kissed pineapple banana and coconut cream the better examples like this one are not dominated by dry oak on the finish subtle spices ginger cocoa powder add intrigue old grain whiskies are hard to find but worth exploring a park avenue liquor exclusive this potent grain whisky from a refill hoggie bears ripe pears green apples vanilla sugar polished horse chestnuts and a waft of acetone neat there is sweet fudge runny caramels and heat but natural dilution dissipates the sweetness to boiled candy with faint cocoa at this strength it really takes water generously illuminating fruitiness and softening the heat dry sweet vanilla pricked

some fresh breath mints divinely sweet orange and lemon puddings caramelized sugars close to burning and soor plooms despite the lemon sweetness at the fringes there remains a central core of mint and clove sherbet lemons fizz on the tongue to finish all is forgiven â£88 the question with this sort of blended malt is whether the whole outperforms the sum of its parts this is a big rich oily and peaty whisky suggesting both the ledaigâthe peated version of tobermory and often a bland maltâand the bowmoreâcapable of big smoke notes when it wants toâare firing on all cylinders theres

gleefully turns cartwheels in the mouth hot dry finish like gargling with hot coals merry peatmas everybody well-balanced offering of sweet citrus grapefruit peel and beach bonfire smoke cream lemon

powerhouse whiskies in the blend including an 87 bunnahabhain it s a surprise that the nose is so reserved with citrus ginger and honey on the palate you need your flavor shovel to unearth a core of

all there is greater concentration and ripeness with an added ginger note another edition that improves on the original thick viscous golden syrup digestive biscuits and almond joy bars underpin some soft peaty aromas it s rather an appealing combination satin smooth on the tongue with lemon lime orange and dried pineapple but enough malt to keep things interesting the finish riffs on a ripe lemon

      " an uncommon exclusive bottling of a 6 year old cask strength malt light gold in color the nose is vegetal more peat bog than peat smoke with an undercurrent of pastry cream and rose it s an odd combination of aromas the entry is flavorful and inviting with smoked pineapple clove and rose peak smoke arrives in full force in the mid-palate which drops the sweet and becomes spicy the finish is mostly smoke but with a pleasant minty coolnessâ  wyoming only a new and welcome permanent member of the core kilchoman range this comes from a mix of sherry finished and sherry matured whisky the nose kicks off with a lovely cigar ash noteâa cigar club toward the end of the eveningâand while there are some dried fruits from the sherry kilchoman s gentle light character gives energy and lemony liftâshellfish grass and herbs lovely balance rounded softly fruity and highly approachable a branded malt meaning we don t know which distillery this whisky came from fresh and quite fruity peach nectarine golden raisin orange pineapple with a nice underlying honey vanilla and caramel sweetness soft gentle malty finish it s clean nicely balanced and pleasant hazelburn was first produced at springbank during 1997 it varies stylistically from traditional  springbank as it is triple distilled using unpeated malt the 8 year old expression has been matured in 60 percent ex-bourbon and 40 percent sherry wood the nose is fresh light fruity and faintly resinous with gentle spice sherbet malt and vanilla on the attractive and lively palate with developing spicy oak and a hint of pepper in the finish master of malt is an online whisky company that seems to try its hand at most things and is bringing a fresh irreverence to the world of whisky this was created in partnership with the bass guitarist of british rock band athlete and its rather good sweet and rich with toffee orange chocolate and honey its another blend with a lot to say for itself â â£55 master of malt has accumulated quite a trophy cabinet for their work on blends the nose is inviting with butter toffee bramley apples fennel seeds cut lawns and chocolate-covered oat biscuits it s a pretty smooth proposition serving up caramel maltiness stewed apple and orange and grapefruit pith with just a hint of sharp lemon freshness to open up with the ginger finish is zappy but short a solid everyday blend we dont see very much craigellachie as a single malt because most of it goes into blending and from that we might draw the conclusion that its not particularly distinctive in its own right if it plays a role in this mix its a submissive one then because after a not altogether enticing nose that has gooseberry green salad and some prickly chili pepper the palate is all about a mouth-coating big pepper hit that stays long into the finish â¬40 the old name for edinburgh has been hijacked for use on this mix of islay malts and appropriate it is the creosote damp outbuilding and oily rope nose is distinctive and strong the peat pronounced in the taste though gooseberry green melon and a trace of kumquat are also in the mix and theres pepper in there too but ultimately the peat holds out and brings up the finish it will soon be 120 years since this workhorse of a distillery came into being golden grahams sanded oak whole lemon floral blooms and cumin seeds on the nose but the whole confection is rather restrained the palate is sweet but could be too sweet for some scottish tablet caramel ripe banana granulated sugar and ginger loaf some late heat accompanies the sugary finish remember to brush your teeth before bed custard creams lemon peel and clotted cream create easygoing aromas on this drop from the mighty edinburgh grain distillery the palate moves rapidly through flavors of lemon cake and lime zest to grapefruit sharpness and fresh pineapple reaching a plateau of sherbet and tangerine like a bulldog chewing a wasp there s lip-puckering sharpness throughout though it s judiciously dosed with sufficient sweetness to counterbalance it a great introduction to the delights of the single grain category 117 bottlesâ â£48 as young a caledonian as you ll find i found the nose rather underdeveloped crystallized lemon slices green banana solvents dry grasses and a sniff of nail polish remover in the mouth lemon flavors saccharine sweet honey and banana dipped in melted chocolate while the alcohol nips at the tongue a good trajectory redeems its character leaving deep throbbing spice notes in the finish with bitter citrus at the fringes more typical grain whisky territory here with a nose of cornflakes fresh cream cut grass filaments of orange peel and a curiously dull pepper note spice sweetness and citrus fight for dominance spice wins with a ko on sweetness and lays the citrus out cold on the canvas creamy chocolate notes tarnished with hot pepper on the finish though coffee-pot flavors emerge with a dash of water a very different whisky to its unaged namesake and most unlike any of the other blends tasted for this issue that s no bad thing\r\n",
      "this is less sweet than most blends with tobacco leaf and ashtray to the fore and a dusty grainy note with a touch of oak grape skin and sweet heather that said not a lot of evidence of the 12 years in cask i have a soft spot for the braes not only a forgotten part of speyside but the only distillery whose roof i ve stood on anyway here you have yeastiness and a smell like just-baked sugar-topped apple pie the fruit cracking through warm pastry sweet direct and slightly nervy braes is never going to be a heavy hitter but this is the ideal dram to conjure up fading memories of summer how can you really compare this to a quality blend priced under $50? its hard not to view this as a victory of style over substance and i object to premium whiskies being just 40% abv but nevertheless this is excellently made and the blending of whiskies over 21 years is exemplary its rich and viscous with light peach and plum notes and a pleasant earthy base amber a thick nose with touches of fresh varnish and a little oiliness has some substance and weight and the heavy florals lily jasmine typical of mature craig alongside toffee the palate is ripe juicy and full the cask adding a slight resinous edge appears slightly smoky becomes fleshy even waxy with water and decidedly more elegant the tannins are supple and some herbal notes emerge it is at its best neat or with water on the sideâ â£80 distilled in june 1994 this example of deanston was aged for 20 years in a refill butt which ultimately yielded 188 bottles quite shy on the nose a hint of starch gentle malt and ginger shows its true colors on the palate relatively full-bodied and sweet with peaches and over-ripe apricots softly spiced the finish is lengthy and sweet with cocoa powder and sprightly oakâ â£87 pale straw this is a classic young caol ila all elbows and knees there is sweetness but it s counteracted by this briny edge and an aroma like firelighters in among smoldering peat shut your eyes and it could be mezcal the smoke envelops the palate while you pick out edible seaweed and smoked oyster on the tongue very bright and would make a good aperitifhighballâ â£50 huge marzipanalmond notes greet you on the first sniff this then moves into an aroma like crepe bandage and even a hint of ointment then lychee and some maltiness the palate is surprisingly feisty with a little orange water brings out mash tun aromas and a pleasing whiff of sheep pens when diluted the palate is very pretty with the almond returning easy drinkingâ â£80 this was distilled the year before carsebridge joined scottish grain distillers under distillers company limited dcl it brings a nose of toasted muffins whole lemon light honey vanilla pencil shavings and a slight herbal hit smooth thick and viscous with light lemon honey gentle spices peach melba and toffee the finish is silky and mouth-coating rich and luxuriant a venerable pleasant old grain but it lacks the zing to become truly exceptional and distinctive 101 bottles â£267 an uncommon 26 year lowland single grain whisky made from wheat and aged in refill bourbon casks oak is quite present on the nose but its not alone theres also bright citrus pine and white cake the opening is softer with vanilla and apricot but its only a brief respite before a very spicy mid-palate focused around oak and white pepper there is a fair amount of fire from the alcohol which drives a very spicy and dry finish us only another blast of new oak fat and creamy with distinct charred elements along with stewing pineapple banana fritters white chocolate suntan oil and a melting bar of nut-filled milk chocolate an instructive dram showing how maturity is very different from age with water some of the distillery finally pokes through to be honest it s slightly too much for me like overdosing on cotton candy or sugar-topped donutsâ â£54 this 2000 vintage expression from glenturret was matured in refill sherry hogsheads before bottling in 2015 as part of gordon & macphail s macphail s collection range the nose is earthy with vanilla treacle and dark berries plus fruit spices full-bodied in the mouth with spicy zesty plums raisins cocktail cherries and nutmeg the finish is lengthy with black treacle cocoa powder and an edge of slightly bitter oak this peated expression from tobermory distillery has been aged in refill remade hogsheads the nose offers earthy peat citrus fruit vanilla and smoked haddock in butter big sweet peat notes on the peppery palate with marshmallows and lively spices the spices linger to the close with peat embers and a hint of brine on the lips â£60 while most wemyss malts  releases are named after flavor descriptors this one adopts a well-known shakespearean reference a sherry butt filled in 2002 gave an out-turn of 854 bottles the nose offers toffee bonbons coffee with condensed milk and finally farmyard aromas the palate is relatively sweet with spicy sherry notes and contrasting mildly citric fruit plus a slight earthiness the finish is medium to long with lingering spice and a carry-over of coffee from the nose â£57 earthy with corn husk and biscuit dough on the nose along with cooked apples white pepper and a light spice honey almond meal toasted marshmallow and a hint of lemon make for a simple somewhat grainy palate it finishes short and sweet with some cinnamon heat costco this is a little darker in color than its younger counterpart see below although it is achieved without the complex recipe of different cask maturation that characterized the 2011 special releases bottling weetabix hazelnut shells and the aroma of warm pretzels from a street vendor waft out of the glass it s a soft silky wheat-flavored whisky that reaches into dark toffee and nutty territory imagine a molten toffee crisp if you like a nougat and walnut-whip finish distinctively different light gold fresh and lightly nuttybiscuity combined with a gently swelling aroma of fruit syrups green grape lime or green jelly babies and quetsch with that nut flour underneath the palate is similarly smooth creamy and upfront with a decidedly acidic zing to the finish before the wood finally shows its presence a soft delicious whisky that ticks all the right boxes but doesn t really set the world alight 2700 bottles at this age there are more linear displays of fruit and sweetness than the 8 year old behind the tarte tatin butterscotch light pepper and wood spice is a green verdant nose of wet foliage and public lawns in the morning mist it has a light to medium-weight texture of sugary butterscotch strawberry and raspberry developing around an oak and malt core when the fruit flavor withers there is a drop off in flavor leaving a malty meleeâ â£48 an odd non-age stated blend that uses a solera system to get a drop of the original 1958 blend into the mix the blend is then finished for four years in oloroso casks its a bit of blending gymnastics very sherry influenced with marionberry jam malt salt and oak the integration and flavors are nice but it all feels a bit muted a medium length and dry finish shows off some of the younger spirit in the mix us only master blender graham coull hand-selected a variety of aged stock and cask types for this new global addition to the label 5 range vanilla dark fruit and gentle spices on the nose but the appeal lies in the beautiful clingy mouthfeel warm marmalade nuts and oak flavors with whispers of cinnamon and clove combine to produce a creamy smooth dram it builds and builds but never feels like it fully arrives the finish is drying with dampened-down spicesâ â¬40 full gold good cask interaction here allowing a light tropical fruit element to emerge alongside peach and apricot juicy and sweet in other words with none of the usual tormore rigidity the palate is equally concentrated showing some heat with a decent degree of fleshy elegance water brings out more dry elements brown bracken hayloft it begins to firm up but it is good enough to change folks  minds about this distilleryâ â£125 it s double wood jim but not as we know it here the blend has been given a madeira finish presenting an appealing nose of spun sugar golden raisins cinnamon nutmeg and hazelnut the blend has a creamy texture with good weight to carry the flavors of orange peel mango and dried pineapple leading to a zesty spark on swallowing wood spices nuttiness and lingering toffee make for a satisfying finish the extra madeira maturation is understated and perfectly judged benachie formerly known as jericho was an aberdeenshire distillery built southeast of huntly that existed from 1822â1913 a dark amber dram with a nose of marmalade ground almond cherry lips and vanilla essence attractive but not overly aromatic cooked plums after a peppery rush begin an attenuated flavor journey exiting with a spicy finale distilled in 1985 this expression of highland park was matured in a single bourbon cask that yielded 252 bottles green apples tinned mandarin oranges linseed and a hint of smoky chocolate on the nose sweet spices coconut and mild peat smoke on the light palate lingering peat smoke root ginger and a touch of vanilla in the medium-length finishâ â£120 surprisingly punchy for its age there s very little cask activity here so what you get is a reduction of caol ila into oils lanolin and whiffs of the harbor drying fishing nets rather than overt smokiness the palate is gentle and shy with an unctuous feel that drifts into poached pear and light cream delicate but also oozing with character best neat this example of the little-seen glentauchers immediately shows classic distillery character which is in the green grassy camp this verdant aspect continues into fresh fruit salad with enough ripeness to indicate the time spent in cask this mix of freshness and weight extends onto the tongue although the impact fades soon after a light spicy tingle on the back palate i d happily have a couple sharp citrus notes like an unruly spritz of grapefruit juice first thing in the morning this is an assertive dram with aromas of lemon bonbon sour fruits toffee fruit sodas and a whiff of potions and unguents wafting from the back room of a pharmacy it floats between sweet and sour fruits settling on a sweet lemon mush wedged between some nibbling spices this single cask bottling from langside distillers was aged in a sherry butt and bottled in 2015 candied orange peel on the early nose soft sweet sherry and glacã© cherries fragrant with milk chocolate-coated turkish delight sweet spicy sherry plus pepper and cinnamon on the uncomplicated palate fruity spices in the medium-length finish 222 bottles robertsons of pitlochry exclusiveâ â£45 from the most westerly grain distillery in scotland comes this wee charmer offering coconut fondant galia melon fresh cream and a pleasing fragrant foliage note walking through dense reed beds in early summer a big juicy dram with citrus tropical fruits and dabs of white pepper heat the creaminess builds as dilution occurs then it reaches a natural plateau and hits cruise an intensely tangy and long finish of dried fruits 232 bottles â£81 drawn from a single refill barrel the nose is like a day in the life of a honeybee streams of pollen rich nectar heady scents of flying over bright summer flowers and summer picnics of white peaches and lemonade before returning to the hive to the sweet sticky honey it s quite a buzz there s an acidic palate of lemon juice lime honey and lemon pith bordering on bitterness the finish is incredibly dry like someone just invented lemon-scented sandpaper 168 bottles â£85 creamy vanilla fresh-cut grass gentle herbal notes murray mints and the warm newsprint wrappers of fish and chips on the coast in a lovely comforting way the cereals provide a sweet biscuit note butterscotch candy gingersnaps and a nip of aniseed the outturn of cask #10804 its taste develops with dried orange peel cookie dough and vanilla quite scrumptious fading slowly it leaves behind gentle spices and syrup-drizzled popcorn 198 bottles â£86 an immediate and perhaps surprising smokiness which brings to mind cask-aged mezcal tepeztate to be precise and it is this green celery-accented element playing off some oily nutty and farmyard notes that gives balance and intrigue water reveals its youth but there s enough cask action to add some weight to the palate where the natural sweet spirit shows itself keenly priced worth a look next time you are flying travel retail exclusive â£68 matured in bourbon casks this is the second release from the fledgling caithness distillery clearly youthful on the nose but not raw with ginger melon and background resin ultimately mildly floral chili notes on the relatively dry palate with nutmeg and spicy oak the finish is on the short side of medium in length peppery and slightly bitter once decanted this dram improves significantly and is rated on that basis 1200 bottlesâ£65 smoke comes at you immediately the morning-after smoke of a spent fire mixing with reeds and rushes a touch of coconut and light oak water is needed to bring out sweetness alongside the band-aid note typical of many young peaty whiskies the palate is a lot sweeter than the nose suggests bold and quite thick honey adding a sticky quality that then moves into creosote and antiseptic cream it needs hefty degrees of dilution a work in progress â£100 the nose has a conspicuous grain quality to it like a bouquet of flowers in a nail salon in addition to acetone there is orange fondant and the smell of new legos soft marshmallow and orange cream dilute to strawberry candy soft peaches and pineapple but it s all swept aside by a tabasco jackhammer that ricochets between the tongue and palate finish of gatorade fruit punch and ginger root 246 bottles with whiskies aged for 5 years in bourbon barrels this has a pleasant nose of dark toffee vanilla toasted whole grain bread and light spices the mouthfeel is a bit flabby chocolate and toasted spices especially cinnamon and pepper are quelled by malty caramel baked orange and touches of old leather the finish is dry malty and slightly nutty with a hollow core of spices a bit dour overall the nose is grassy and light with some youthful heat orange blossom vanilla coconut and cedar a clean palate of lemon orange vanilla banana and toasted coconut leads into a simple finish of oak and more vanilla basic but well balanced total wine & more this blend has been a whyte and mackay whisky for 25 years the nose has spice toffee wheat biscuits and smoke but the combination feels a little benign the palate is jammy lightweight and middle-of-the-road with a backbone of grain there are flavors of graham cracker chocolate ganache well-baked fruitcake banoffee pie smoke and dried peels with a burst of spices on the finish brian kinsman s new creation was inspired by their founder william grant with a remit to create a malty blend of character digestive biscuits malt honeycomb and confectioner s chocolate melted over a bain-marie it s a satisfyingly rich dram well-structured with a great mouthfeel that wanes with natural dilution banoffee pie caramel biscuits and maltiness deepen to flavors of coffee bean and molasses leaving a teeth-coating finish of black coffee uk and france onlyâ â£18 if you aren t expecting it the herbaceous grassy mineral aromas are a surprise more expected in an agave spirit than a typical speysider but there s something entrancing about the herbal flavors of tarragon licorice tea chestnut honey and saline which resolve into a lightly sweet slightly spiced finish this is unusual but beguiling trader joe s the nose is pleasant with fresh strawberry spicy smoke cookie dough allspice and glacã© cherry but the palate fails to shine or excite this has been finished in port and pedro ximã©nez casks giving the whisky a subtle rose hue but it needs more body there are flavors of biscuit mandarin vanilla and redcurrant it meanders along with a fairly flat trajectory then hits the buffers with some lingering rosehip fruitiness 2266 bottles for us this soft bright easy-going whisky is back in the us after being absent for several years very fragrant with vibrant fruit nectarine plum guava pineapple clementine honeyed vanilla and subtle macadamia fairly light a pre-dinner or leisurely afternoon malt perhaps? but evenly balanced a gentle introduction to single malts for the blended scotch drinker a blend of three different single malts its name derives from the fact that the whisky is aged in american oak bodies with french oak heads a cross of both oaks there s no age statement but the whiskies are all older than ten years this is a gentle subtly complex somewhat lithe easy drinking whisky and with less oak spice than its predecessor the spice tree people think whisky is an after-dinner drink but i think this would make a great aperitif because of its delicate dry spice notes and light body i m picking up evenly-proportioned notes of vanilla and coconut with more subtle notes of clove anise and delicate fruit all wrapped up in a

feistier and want to make sure you know they re there this is the former and with whiskies like this one it s possible to blink and miss it that doesn t make it bad just indistinctive and

substantial with lemon pecan and in time chestnut it s this last aroma that carries through most strongly onto the tongue there s light grip and even at 46% some level of heat water reveals oak and

sherry cask retains an air of ambiguity to it theoretically it could be the maturation or finishing vessel for all or some of the constituents the whisky is light-bodied and the sweet sherry is evident though a nip of bitterness interrupts smoother on the palate than the 12 year old there s strawberry raspberry and background spice with a blackberry note late in the finish overall there s less flavor development but it s an old-school kind of blend an official strathclyde from chivas bros presented in its squat bottle from their under-appreciated cask strength edition series i found a peculiar nose comprising shafts of lemongrass garlic bulb root ginger taffy candy and green tea as an iron dram it s oily and bold with coconut fresh mint and green pea with a savory note tugging at the taste buds dilution highlights scallions a light creamy toffee and reese s peanut butter cups curiously intriguing for bold flavor explorers onlyâ â£43 massive with a huge sherried attack seven years is the right time to bottle there s light raisin date and fig rolltreacle toffee but it s a funny one as it develops while it is superficially impressive it becomes clear that the oak-driven and distillery-derived parts aren t talking to each other water brings out light cask-driven sulfur on the palate the black fruits and demerara rum take initial charge along with menthol it s tannic already though lacks integration but what else to do? it s been four years since diageo last released an official single grain whisky from this glasgow distillery this will kick off your evening with its aromas of golden syrup flapjacks light vanilla sponge fingers and waxy linseeds the american oak notes are all over this vanilla sweet granola and pecan yet there is a squeeze of lemon and a square of milk chocolate too the creamy finish has real length and makes this a most accessible grain whisky delicate nose of sherbet and melting heather honey layered over pleasant grassy and herbal notes the texture is sweet thin and syrupy with a slight vegetal note before salted caramel reels it in brimming over into a briny finish like a salty kiss the grain clearly plays a major role truth

label 5 range and it s a solid reputable blend that works neat with a rock of ice or in cocktails the digestive biscuits dark walnut toffee and fruit salad aromas concede to a rather inauspicious palate of burnt orange malt biscuits charred oak and ground ginger it s lively through to its malt and spice conclusion once again some assertive distillery character to the fore which in benriach s case means plenty of ripe sweet fruits cooked apples a jag of citrus and a background malty note there s a pleasant slightly oxidative wine-like note with water the sweetness dominates the palate with the nuttiness moving to hot breakfast cereal and in typical benriach fashion a sweet spiced finish lovely but not overly different from official bottlings this blend is generously half malt and half grain unusually selecting 16-18 year old malts the result has a nose of rich honey and florals resplendent in a citrus intensity squeezed orange skin with a background note of dry crackers the palate is orange and malty with cola faint spices and a little waxiness but the core feels a little hollow a good length finish where the pleasant buzz has a slight peatiness rubbed in a decent stand-up dram oh boy it s like tearing open a warm banana-and-toffee muffin the steam bringing the moist sweet goodness to your nostrils roasted peach and neat orange cordial join the party on the palate the alcohol strength is noticeably strong with flavors of red currant cranberry and black pepper at the fruitier end of the cambus spectrum this concludes with a whimper of spices leading to a nip of cinnamon and bitter vanilla in the tail 270 bottles â£87 gold color aroma of vanilla honeyed malt subtle marshmallow with background herbal hay-like notes light and creamy in body creamy malty vanilla

no shortage of good to great grain whisky on the market i feel this one is past its best 258 bottles £90 this may be the best-known belgian single grain whisky and it vies for attention with its perfumed nose of violet creams acetone and peach juice with ripe mango and papaya unfortunately the body is lacking yielding up a juicy collision of tropical fruits and icing sugar sweetness but after

coconut and tropical fruit but the rest of this grain whisky is a bit of a disappointment it is thin and at times harsh a paint thinner component is evident especially on the nose along with more wood

salted fish in the mix its a full-on savory experience and not one for the faint-hearted sek 1295 a slightly perfumed nose offers up the slightly unusual pairing of dried lavender sweet-cured herring and then potpourri air freshener this flies off to show wet dulse on warm sand it starts sweetly with some nutmeg then hot peppers the smoke is very light allowing a tantalizing glimpse of soft guava before the salinity returns water brings out the peat kiln but also that initial perfume muddledâ â£700 quite a solid start for a caol ila which like the 30 year old see above pitches you into the farmyard though this time it s a sheep-shearing shed there s also some bacon and spent barbecue the initial impression is of a pretty dry example but some oil begins to seep through the palate is explosive with some engine oil becoming pretty flinty with violet notes and the distillery sweetness is hidden a little disjointedâ â£135 the oldest of the new trio here you can see how the smoke has become fully absorbed accenting the peapod and spearmint giving depth to the still-fresh ozonic elements there are light levels of complexity even a little chocolate the tongue when neat goes deep into pear and apple but it s edgy adding water however shows the lack of oak integration i d want more from a whisky of this age and price â£199 as with the 30 year old here you get the sense of smoke being absorbed rather than being expressive there s not a lot of cask at work hereâthis has real minerality and an oily brininess bringing to mind a hot outboard motor on a fishing trip halfway in a fire ignites sending clouds of smoke forward but then it dries too quickly good but just not enough oak to give it depth and length â£80 one of the newest of the distillers edition family here royal lochnagar has been given its secondary resting period in muscat casks that nodule of sweetness in the 12 year old has been picked up and extended into a more perfumed world think blueberry muffin and

substantially different guise than normal yes this is fresh sweet and malty - to be precise draff-like - but there s smoke as well and a fairly decent belt of it young it may be - amazingly it s less than 2 years old - but the palate especially with water is cleansing and with vanilla good phenols and orris-like dryness very intriguing â£18 200 ml the onionskin hue gives the initial indication that this was finished in a port pipe the nose is light and fruity raspberry and cranberry juice even a sprig of mint fresh but with a background funkiness in time there s ripe melon then lightly musty wood comes through the palate is light giving the effect of diluted fruit juice it s all just a bit lacking in weightâ â£25 the name s a little misleading - this is actually the second whisky to be released from england s only distillery it s only three years old so don t expect too much depth but it s a significant step up from the first release it s made by legendary former laphroaig distiller iain henderson and it s peated so expect a treat there s not much happening on the nose with some fluffy fruit masking a touch of charcoal smoke but on the palate it goes through the gears with melon and pear giving way to a wave of licorice before the peat kicks in and stays it s a bit like seeing a talented teenager try out for a sports team lots of talent no obvious weaknesses but not yet big enough to front up to the first team and in need of some muscle nevertheless surprisingly balanced and rounded and a sign of good things to come selected british whisky outlets england s sole whisky distillery currently at any rate anything could and probably will happen is located in norfolk where farmer andrew nelstrop started distilling in november 2006 small batches have been released in chapters  giving whisky lovers teasing glimpses of how the spirit is maturing light and delicate - there s also a peated variant - nelstrop reckons it will hit its peak in its early teens i see no reason to dispute him this chapter is picking up a straw color and has a nose that s reminiscent of fresh barley while a little citrus hangs around at the back young - think green apple and green grass with milled flour on the tongue - it s a whistle-clean whisky â£38 signature was new to the singleton of glen ord range in 2013 as part of the travel retail exclusive singleton reserve collection soft toffee banana and ginger on the nose accompanied by slightly herbal and pine notes sweet and easy-drinking with a suggestion of sherry and drying oak licorice in the finish rm263 the double maturation here is a vatting of bourbon and sherry casks finished off in what diageo will only say is a special cask that s helpful there s a breakfast-style opening here of warm bagels with grape jelly then comes citrus before some of that dusky distillery character creeps in it s quite bulked-up in the center of the palate but finishes cleanly one for those who like things on the thick-set side travel retail exclusive a similar story to the 30 year old despite a truly excellent nose this time more sherry influences dominate think of polished wood damsons and a little mentholcamphor and resinous oak once again the palate seems to be slightly dumber than i d want from a venerable whisky that should be about elegant complex expression it s balanced just a little faded again maybe higher strength might have done the trick â£140 light gold fresh and clean with light draff notes cool porcelain lemon cereal husk it becomes more expressive on the tongue though it remains subtle a bit of a stealth bomb because the palate shows plenty of spice cinnamon toast and baklava the finish reveals some green notes when you add water it becomes incredibly minty fragile

the tongue with some cereal and a certain fatness water brings out a little more from the cask a delicate and pleasant enough dram but i m slightly bemused as to why it s being bottled at this age when there s clearly so much more to giveâ â£69 very pale straw the color indicates that there s been no real cask activity a little closed on the nose to start clean quite green and leafy young ferns the flavor however makes up for this with good mid-palate sweetness and some dark fruits beginning to assemble themselves in the middle of interest to completistsâ â£45 another youthful offering from douglas laing in its premier barrel series presented in one of 863 ceramic decanters this glengoyne initially offers a nose of cherries and treacle before tinned tomatoes make their presence felt

following a similarly youthful provenance range bottling of talisker and an nas young and feisty variant douglas laing has opted to release this 5 year old expression in its premier barrel lineup complete with ceramic decanter 495 of which were produced initially meaty then peat smoke envelops the nose with damp tweed backing it up black pepper and gunpowder tea on the bold palate flinty with lemon and lime lingering black pepper and a metallic tang in the finishâ â£75 there is something very bedtime drink about this glenallachie without it being a dram to have before retiring for the night it s to do with the aromatic sensation of powdered malted milk and cocoa powder the palate is simple with some fresh apple pear juice and a lightly sour edge the draffmalted milk re-emerges in the middle of the tongue with water pears come through making it similar to a tequila blanco all rather delicate â£63 this could be seen as a brave young bottling of the sometimes divisive fettercairn single malt but glenkeir treasures has acquired some interesting casks which showcase the youthful whisky to good advantage wet cardboard starch and savory notes on the initial nose settling down to

without massive complexity this expression from macduff distillery was launched along with its 12 and 18 year old siblings in 2015 the nose is fresh and floral and offers light cereal notes and soft

far more in common with its highland cousins the entry level 10 year old variant offers resin oil cereal and pine notes on the delicate nose comparatively light bodied with malt and drying saltiness in the mouth along with a hint of aniseed the finish is malty and nutty with more salt plus just a wisp of smoke comus is the name of a frankly terrifying english folk group who taps into the dark pagan spirit underpinning that music an apposite name then for the laddie s most heavily-peated variant if you want to know what it s like to stand beside a kiln then sniff this but the distillery s sweetness is retained here in the guise of pineapple and banana the palate is like eucalyptus lozenges with light maltiness before that laddie thickness makes things even sweeter shy is the word pale in color again suggestive of little cask interaction there s a little hint of white currant and light cereal delicate and fragile - more fragile than the balmenach - with a little touch of white chocolate as it opens out comes violet the mouth is tense as if everything is still baled up even after all this time very light acidity gives a certain freshness that water doesn t shake loose simply not enough cask â£67 finishing in octave-sized px casks has resulted in the creation of an oddity the world s first ardbeg cordial there s smoke pigskin leather and a sudden rootiness mixed with damp

      " distilled at the start of 2009 this special edition was bottled mid-2014 making it a 5 _ year old whisky the nose is ashy paste with a good measure of barnyard funk along with sherry oak and clove spice the entry is all ashtray a late night of sweet wine and cigarettes sherry notes fight the smoke to emerge but the smoke simply dominates a smoky ashy spicy and dry finish round out a face-slapper of a whisky us only touches of acetone and magic markersolvent suggest that thereõs precious little cask involvement going on here pleasing enough with lime jelly and kiwi fruits and a little whiff of sweet oak but itõs very understated in the mouth it performs in a nutty way but doesnõt seem to have moved much over its quarter of a century sequestration there is some horchata and brazil nut even a mashy note but it either needs more time or a kick to get it moving £70 hailing from the speyside distillery this has a deep orange color and an aroma of damp hay and a slightly vegetal note alongside caramel and peanut brittle a perception of bitterness beside dried peels the palate is thick with stewing fruits tinned prune and burnt sugar with a background note of wet draff water lifts things a little but its all rather sick and flabby £150 this bottling from an unspecified highland distillery is intended to represent the style of whisky to be produced in the raasay distillery currently under construction peated to a level of 15ppm this expression has been finished in tuscan red wine casks 4000 bottles are available buttery farmyard aromas with red berries and a sense of relative youth silky on the palate with intense fruit sweetness and an immediate delivery of very spicy peat pepper and peat in a medium-length finish £55 nice to see arran making it to 12 years old creamy on the palate and soothing in nature with layers of sweetness maple and butterscotch syrup vanilla cream and fruit caramel apple fried banana soft congenial finish a low-level yet persistent nuttyburnt rubber note detracts from what would otherwise be a very fun pleasantly sweet whisky note at the time of publication the whisky was not yet available in the us price above is uk price converted to dollars this whisky comes from two bourbon casks producing only 112 bottles i believe itõs the most expensive lowland whisky on the market unfortunately its flavor doesnõt stand up to its price while i applaud morrison bowmores efforts to give us the opportunity to try such a mature expression of auchentoshan i feel that the whisky is past its prime i wouldnt describe it as overly woody like i have other whiskies that are 41 years old rather i would describe it as overly funky the whiskys aroma and flavor are very peculiar with plenty of vegetal notes cucumbers especially combined with stewed fruit golden raisins rose petals and spice anise clove if it were $100 a bottle i would suggest that you gather a few friends to chip in and buy a bottle just for the experience but at $2000 i think we should leave this one for the collectors a very peculiar whisky itõs interesting in some respects with the thick sweet hungarian dessert wine fighting with damp peat smoke for attention but it tastes a little disjointed and a bit too youthful with a few more years aging before finishing in the tokaji wine the flavors should integrate and mature better but as it is this whisky is still òwork in progressó the owners of bunnahabhain are making a peated version of this normally unpeated islay whisky to put in their peated blend black bottle but they have not yet put out as a regular item a peated expression of bunnahabhain for purchase however some of the independent bottlers got their hands on some and this might be the first one to be offered in the us itõs what you would expect a 9 year old peated bunnahabhain to taste like toffee vanilla fudge and nuts the bunny signature kiln peat smoke and a bit too much youthfulness it needs a few more years to mature to acceptable levels bottled for binnyõs beverage depot the lightness of the hue suggests a very slow maturation in refill casks and while i tried hard to get to grips with this i found the nose simply too discreet thereõs a hint of the burning bonfire which indicates the subtle smoke that underpins cragganmore thereõs even some parma violet dried berries and a hint of sulfur the palate picks things up a little showing ferns wet moss oolong tea and dried apple as well as citrus and ñ surprisingly ñ some just-lit cigar fuminess itõs all rather understated however this is one of my top distilleries but compared to the recent special releases and magnificent friends of the classic malts bottlings this is slightly underwhelming the second of the duo ñ destined for the us and taiwan ñ is a relative youngster and has been extracted from a fresh spanish oak sherry hogshead the combination of first-fill and smaller cask size is immediately apparent the color is mocha dark and the nose has a distinctly sulfurous twist behind which are black cherries dipped in chocolate tonka bean and leather for me thereõs too much cask and not sufficient rothes complexities especially on the palate since a change of ownership in 2014 the loch lomond range has been revamped with the previous blue and black label single malt variants being dropped in favor of this repackaged nas expression farmyard aromas on the early nose then emerging malt and caramel discreet oak rounded on the palate with immediate citrus fruits toffee allspice and a suggestion of smoke spices persist through a slightly citric cerealy medium-length finish since diageo has included knockando in its special release program it seemed only right to reacquaint myself with the standard bottling this is speyside in its maltiest guise the nose is reminiscent of breakfast cereal weetabix and bran flakes with a whisper of vanilla the palate is light and dusty and you get the impression that the malt just wants to scuttle across the tongue and down the throat as quickly as possible a shy wee mouse of a dram £30 this robert burns world federation arran single island malt is the calvados or poire williams of the whisky world theres no age statement on this whisky but it has the classic aromas and flavors of sweet pears prominent in very young distilled spirits the vanilla notes along with its pale color suggest a used bourbon cask i suppose one could treat it as an aperitif and possibly chill it down or serve it on the rocks citrus peel light maple syrup and almonds with emerging grape and vanilla somewhat elegant in nature but the flavors do not especially complement each other exclusive to binnyõs beverage depot mackmyra makes no secret of the fact that it borrowed the idea for this release from its american friends the name means white dog but the taste is all scotland its sappy fresh raw and vegetal with some pleasing menthol notes perhaps the most interesting aspect of it is how much like scotch new make it tastes suggesting that swedish barrels have a very big say in the final product sek 319 what a contrast with the standard bottling here we have knockando in a hugely active cask and sadly its fragile character collapses under the assault the nose is oily and sulphury with notes of sealing wax turkish tobacco and maraschino the palate is dry and tannic the opposite of what is needed for a whisky that is nutty and dusty in the first place huge oak impact for such a young whisky fresh oak shavings dry vanilla and subtle toasted coconut throughout some dried fruit sultana and toffee up front but this is quickly consumed by the oak dry hot resinous finish not an old whisky but already showing too much oak deep thick nose with sappy oak dried citrus old leather spearmint and background leafy smoke nicely viscous on the palate with similar notes as the aroma but mid-palate the age gets the best of this whisky the flavors flatten out and the wood dominates through the finish as the leather notes linger itõs a rare treat to taste a whisky this old if you like lalique and have the money then this new bottling is worth some consideration because there are certainly moments of intrigue and pleasure on the nose and beginning of the palate but i have tasted several other 50-plus year old macallans and i can say with certainty that the 50 year old millennium bottling and the 1946 vintage release were better and can probably still be found for a significantly lower price only 420 bottles available worldwide this lowland distillery only operated from 1957-1975 huge bourbon impact on the nose and palate along with vanilla coconut stewed fruit and dried wood spice -- especially on the finish with lingering notes of anise espresso very dark chocolate and charcoal a taste of history for sure but this is a whisky that never was meant to be aged this long\n",

      " this oldie from a distillery which closed in 2000 seems pretty straightforward compared to the mizunara [see following review] but has less dried fruit than the sherry note on the label might suggest think dried peels rather than raisin then stir in some freshly-polished floor the aromas are saturated and heavy - almost as if they are drifting towards you on humid air\r\n",

there s just enough body apparent as the spices settle down unleashing a substantial wave of vanilla creaminess leaves a long aftertaste like a light-hearted pillow fight between the vanilla cream and the fading spices the unusual distilling process and some maturation in madeira casks has given standard penderyn a liqueur-like perfumey quality many whisky fans don t care for this is a single bourbon cask bottling of the 11th cask the distillery ever filled to mark its 10th anniversary and is less cloying less feminine and more gutsy than the standard version it s also very palatable and of excellent quality some will make it to america but the price tag will deter all but the most passionate penderyn will miss distiller gillian macdonald who has gone to work at glenmorangie because

apple blueberries and spirit-soaked black and red berries all delivered with a power punch great â£30 penderyn quotes a respected writer on its website saying that no one does port-influenced whisky

comedian tommy cooper - but still unforgettable and easy to fall in love with 256 bottles â£146 smoked meat paprika cumin peppercorn and star anise amid fragrant smoke and maple bacon the flavors are supremely fruity with tangerine marmalade lime zest and pineapple juice among the fruit is a cascade of aromatic spices before the interjection of a most compelling sour fruit note and the smokiness takes charge it s certainly no islay mimic this terrific indian whisky demonstrates it has the courage of its own convictions poised and complex with typically lifted fruitiness strawberry ice cream pineapple peach balanced by delicate oak bamboo shoot-like delicacy then lemon the palate is more rounded than that very forward nose with toffee notes adding some weight a touch of smoke comes along in the mid-palate before fruits and caramelized coffee biscuits water allows the flavors to flood the palate exemplary blending skills and classically hibiki this single malt bottling shows miyagikyo s emollient style at its best this is all about super-soft orchard fruits think apricot and sweet persimmon though there s also a touch of sweet sawdust and even a whiff of pine sap and milk chocolate it demonstrates the classic japanese trick of being both clear and precise in its aromas as well as being heightened in intensity the palate is a little slow to start with offering a mix of spruce and pine then those soft fruits carry you onward \r\n",

a small independent new zealand whisky company with a limited amount of stock originally distilled at the willowbank distillery and this is as young as new zealand whisky currently gets one suspects it would have benefited from a couple more years but its simple sugar and spice combo and rich citrus heart make it an uncomplicated but very drinkable session malt its a waltz of a whisky that kicks a bit at the death nz$85 the distillery makes big claims for this whisky stressing that it shares the same high production values as scotland and the importance of altitude in the highveld to maturation this is the first whisky release from a pretoria brewery and it is fascinating the nose is confused but the palate is liqueur-like with blackcurrant cordial and vimto [a uk fruit-herb soda] its problem is its youth it s not yet fully integrated and there are immature rootsy notes here but it s promising â¬36 currently not available in the us there are big similarities with this whisky

new world whisky i tell folks to treat it not as a scotch but as a totally different whisky but how far can you go? the french have a whisky made with buckwheat - technically not a grain - and chestnuts now we have this this is light sweet with flavored candy and fruit jelly lots of pruney grapey cognac notes theres the issue is it a nice drink? yes is it really a whisky? its up for debate aged exclusively in cognac casks here is hanyu again showing its thick earth-rooted solidity even to the extent of some rootier elements showing that said on the nose some water brings out jasmine frangipani and mace with a light buttery note it s very spicy on the tongue nutmeg mixed with bitter roots but as with the ace of clubs water just increases dryness a bit too rigid for me â¥14000\t a single malt it may be because it s the product of one distillery but a single grain it s not in fact there are three malted grains in this and that makes for a punchy vibrant fruity and menthol-tinged new make spirit but with a sweet cereal note and some distinctive spiciness from the rye different and interesting up to a point very well made but still new make spirit at the end of the day â¬30 its the sheer chutzpah of these young whisky producers that i adore they dont care theyre skate punks crashing through the whisky suburbs flipping cartwheels and turning the world upside down this

aniseedâ â¬38 the original penderyn is finished in madeira casks i like the original better which i rated an 84 as it tastes more mature and the madeira seems to dovetail better with the other

everything to come together? this is very different to previous belgian owl bottlings but it s important because it takes the distillery to a new place there are hints of glen garioch or springbank

should be sited in the wilds of tasmania with a smart visitor center and a bar that overlooks the rolling rugged countryside the whiskey though is surprisingly gentle and soft there is an overly

this space $aus 190500 ml given that this is described as a blend and its from the new zealand whisky co youd be well within your rights to stay clear but its not it s a blend of two single malts from two different countries new zealand and australia what will soon be known as hybrid its not the best from either country dumbing down the big flavors and leaving the fruit and spice falling a little flat arguably another good entry level whisky though nz$95 this is a spanish whisky from the granada region its not spains first whisky or its best but this could eventually be a contender its problem is that it has sulfur all over it a deliberate attempt to empower the malt or sloppy whisky making? get past it though and this is a thin light orange and mandarin aperitif whisky and ideal to serve chilled early on a sunny summer spanish evening its about context not earth-shattering though â¬80 the makers of unser bier in the gundeli district of basel produce this young whisky and host an annual seminar in november where guests learn about distillation and maturation from the master brewer the nose has honey and melon but it s drenched in the sweet wine notes the palate mingles the melon and honey flavors with sugared sultana until the sweetness abates bringing out more fruit skins then a surprising spearmint note on the finish chf79 this edition was matured in bourbon but finished in madeira casks which lends it a honeyed sweet nose of cream soda lychee whole almond and dried tropical fruit smartly the finishing cask gives a lift but never dominates a fresh clean taste but the mouthfeel has a frailty so although you will find lemon icing sugar candy bananas and molten honey this doesn t quite live up to its rousing nameâ â£31 kaiapoi is a small town in north canterbury new zealand and was in the frontline of the recent horrific earthquake that wrecked this pretty part of the south island made by distiller john fitzgerald and matured for 13 years this whisky has been something of a secret it tastes like nothing else on earth it s like germany s blaue maus - working off a different template than scotch imagine sweet alcoholic hazelnuts giving way to spice lacks depth though made entirely with spanish barley and showing healthy progress this 10 year old single malt is further proof that owner beam global is committed to producing quality spanish single malt but it has some way to go this is a seã±orita not a matador and is far too polite - more like a blend than a single malt orange jelly marzipan and apple pip all make an appearance but it s all too safe age statements are disappearing from japanese whiskies but this 80% grain content blended whisky from sasanokawa shuzo is evidence that age is no substitute for flavor a tight nose of lychee white pepper allspice and toasted oats is bettered by a sweet light profile yielding american oak characteristics of vanilla and creamed coconut it s quickly dominated by intensely spicy seasoning overcoming late notes of burnt orange fresh fig and sour grapefruit peel before a finish of peppered mackerel 1992 bottles europe onlyâ â¬130 my feelings here are the same as for the sherrywood it comes across as younger and less mature than the original madeira wood finish version this one has some peat smoke in the mix malty sweet with some graham cracker nougat and hints of butterscotch peppered with light smoke quick lightly smoky finish this is matured in 100 liter casks and the port is all over the youthful spirit but while the combination leaves a lot to be desired

as a base for summer cocktails a non-age statement spanish malt whisky whereas scotch whisky is often a showcase of the grain this spanish malt is all about spotlighting the unique palo cortado sherry cask monster raisin leads things off and is followed by apricot jam honey ginger and grape blossom the impact of sherry is so great it borders on tasting like an interesting young spanish brandy a very spicy mid-palate which is a little hot drives a very dry finish us only no age statement on this grain whisky made from spanish corn and aged in palo cortado sherry casks whereas the navazos-palazzi malt captured the richness of the sherry the grain seems to pull the more acidic and dry qualities here its dry sherry coffee bean brown sugar and white pepper much hotter and drier than the navazos-palazzi malt it explodes with heat and spice this grain whisky was probably never meant to be consumed unblended and it shows us only a quadruple-distilled whisky in a glass-stoppered bottle the sherry influence has left its mark on the nose with ripe victoria plums glac cherry ripening strawberries icing sugar and mixed peel too bad the flavors are profoundly bitter and minty producing an expression on this reviewerõs face like a flinching child reluctantly ingesting an unwelcome spoonful of medicine more palatable and fruity as it dilutes some spearmint returns on the finish but it was game over by then the wine cask anoints a gentle amber hue to this natural-colored whisky that has a nose redolent of wine gums it has a firm texture with early promises of apple and blackberry but then the flavors tumble off a cliff a mouth-puckering bedlam of unsweetened rhubarb cough medicine licorice and aniseed a dash of water extinguishes many of the sour notes but any redeeming qualities are weakened too leaving it bland and saggy hard to love this one surprisingly lively very much like the 21 year old release in this regard but not as spicy on the nose or palate instead the spice is replaced by a layered satisfying sweetness -- not by wood like the somewhat lethargic oak-dominated 23 year old release older doesn t mean that it tastes older deep nutty toffee foundation with nougat candied tropical fruit and shoo-fly pie the spices cinnamon spearmint vanilla cocoa powder emerge mid-palate and linger warming the finish not as vibrant as the 21 year old expression but more sophisticated i can t speak for the other barrels in this lot but i think this one is a great example of what a 20-plus year old rye whiskey should taste like deep amber color bold and surprisingly youthful aromas and quite vibrant for its age-huge spicy notes mint cinnamon vanilla anise freshly ground pepper with rich toffee caramel and background fruit rich enveloping body enormous in flavor with youthful dynamic spices mint cinnamon vanilla pepper wrapped in rich toffee and molasses tamed by mature oak and leather notes the flavors intensify on the palate ultimately

citrus chocolate and a hint of tobacco violet candies rose petal and lots of fresh grainy aromas meet hints of candle wax on the nose the palate is quite pretty and pure and delivers good intensity of white pepper spice citrus and vanilla cream before a fairly short finish does not hold up to water but there are some nice flavors here a veteran rye whiskey brand that flaunts the floral quality of younger ryes with its summer flowers bright citrus and lemon oil notes a well-polished palate with warm porridge and grain notes that smack of peanut butter on warm toast nice character and balance if a touch anemic at this proof named for the town of deadwood sd where wild bill hickok was gunned down in 1876 a blend of two rye mashbills 95% rye and 70% rye aged at least 2 years in american oak orange blossom on the nose herbal notes pine nuts anise and fragrant oak a honeyed palate offers kiwi tangerine and orange balanced against bitter chocolate and espresso the finish is sweet with floral orange notes and chocolate syrup a 5 year old rye whisky made in lawrenceburg ind with the signature ldi 95% rye mashbill that went through the lincoln county process after aging a somewhat anemic nose lightly grassy sweet with edges of mint vanilla and oatmeal the mouth is more rewarding the rye s bitter spice and sweet mint emerge to flame across the tongue it s very easy to drink with a flare of oily mint intensity at the finish good but you expect more from dickel a 100% straight rye from canada this is curiously similar to and more affordable than whistlepig rye which is also a 100% rye 10 year old canadian whisky but at a slightly higher 50% abv neither whiskey identifies its origin it oozes spice mint cinnamon hint of nutmeg balanced by layers of sweetness honeyed vanilla caramel with nutty toffee emerging on the finish whiffs of whole cloves quickly turn to cedar shavings acetone menthol horse liniment corn syrup and german rye bread brighter and fresher than other 100% ryes but somehow a bit muddied with a grainy earthy wet-clay mealiness searing spices turn rye drinking into an extreme sport leather peppermint sweetish rye grain and firewood gradually emerge a blistering finish pulls like tannic black tea while underlying rye grain notes drift along forever initially an unwanted mustiness is present but it quickly turns into a damp cellar note followed by dill eucalyptus fresh oak and mint hints of smoke emerge over pecan shell and chewing tobacco then a cherry cough syrup note appears with baking spices gaining steam but the whiskey never truly finds a desired dominant note or balance the finish gives it hope it lingers with a hint of brown sugar unlike the knob creek bourbons which are 9 years old there s no age statement with this new rye which tastes relatively younger it s bracing vibrant and spicy the rye contribution is unmistakable cinnamon spice and crisp mint dominate with charcoal botanicals ginger nutmeg honeyed fruit vanilla and caramel warming spice finish its dynamic personality should shine in cocktails but from a sipping drinking neat perspective i wish it was a little older like its siblings the old beam rye never got a lot of respect from aficionados it s been pulled reformulated and repackaged let s try it smell sweet grass and pepper taste hot flashy sweet on top with rye oiliness underneath a tickling bitterness that blends well with oak into the finish the higher proof plays well giving this a punch of flavor the old yellow label didn t have and at a good price it s manhattan time value pick no age statement but it includes 4 to 7 year old whiskeys the mashbill is 95% rye - much higher than most standard rye whiskeys out there it s brisk vibrant and loaded with spice crisp mint warming cinnamon cocoa hint of anise fruit - ripe nectarine apricot golden raisin - drizzled with maple syrup dry oak rounds out the finish bold enough for cocktails mature enough to drink neat or on the rocks very different than other straight rye whiskeys you might be familiar with there s no corn in the recipe just a large percentage of rye and a small amount of malted barley it s youthful with spice as the defining character cinnamon mint allspice freshly ground pepper balanced by blackberry preserve caramel butterscotch and a hint of cotton candy lingering dried spice and polished oak on the finish provide balance to the sweeter notes this non-chill filtered rye is bold and ready for a spice-hungry palate at first the aroma gently introduces herbs pepper spice cinnamon and vanilla preparing for a hopeful taste of the same instead there s a surprise toasted rye bread at the beginning followed by cinnamon and caramel with a medium-length finish a very grain-forward nose reminiscent of caraway or a fresh pumpernickel loaf a soft dusty rye with hints of peppermint spearmint and cinnamon candy and bitter brown sugar quite dry with some bitter oak dry hay and fresh-sawn lumber dried herbs grilled pineapple and lingering pepper on the finish made from rye malted by hand and distilled in direct-fired stills this whiskey is more focused on grain than oak empire rye bright grainy rye in the nose bitter and green with contrasting streak of sweet cola quite balanced in the mouth the rye is more savory and saves the bitter spark for the finish the sweetness less obvious the body neither featherweight nor heavy that s really not bad at all sourced whiskey a true fruit bouquet on the nose with apple lemon peach and apricots balanced by gentle wood very buttery and creamy on the palate with a panoply of earthy white chocolate pretty baking spice and minced apple a little too much fresh lumber and banana flavor but well-balanced and intriguing the applejack cask finish is a nice touch but the rye could still use more time in the barrel empire rye very grassy with dry earth and pink peppercorn layered in but none of the heat you d expect from unaged 92 proof rye very well-behaved on the tongue oily bittersweet with the 95% rye mash rolling like an unhurried river one long smooth wave of rye flavor a whiskey like this could be called too simple but this is strikingly single-minded a likely candidate for cocktails at the price think of an herb garden it s pronounced with herbs such as parsley dill and hints of basil and mint fruits develop canned peaches and pears followed by earth floral and oak then a medicinal note sets in forming as cherry cough syrup striking an unbalanced astringent mouthfeel with hints of mint and salted chocolate a drop of water softens the medicinal approach and returns the herbal fruity and earthy richness finishes medium with a hint of dill three and half year old rye finished in rum casks from barbados rum-influenced notes of ripe mango guava and orange curaã§ao dominate the nose a light nimble mouthfeel with rum sweetness on the palate plus candied mandarin lemon pineapple and a light pine note similar notes on the finish helped by a sprinkling of white pepper flavorful and rich with the overlay of rum sweetness dominating the rye notes to some degree orange and flower aromas mingled with cinnamon candy tea leaves and fresh-cut wood show off the lively side of the grain from the start in the mouth this whiskey is spicy and vibrant with chili pepper hot tamales green banana and plenty of oak finishing on dark chocolate black tea and lingering heat a young whiskey but well on its way orange mango strawberry candy and licorice on the nose while water brings out watermelon more mango and a soft wood note a light palate offers fruitcake orange blackberry chocolate almond gingersnaps tobacco and cedar spice a finish of vanilla orange and more tobacco with water bringing out hot chocolate orange burnt espresso beans and drying oak orangey and tropical at the outset but also deep and nutty particularly on the finish distilled and aged in indiana it s herbal floral and slightly fruity with a hint of cherry syrup resounding dried apricot and peach cobbler are followed by concentrated caramel and vanilla creating a very pleasing and easy-drinking whiskey although not complex nor with a strong finish it s perfectly balanced by intense notes perfect for cocktails or table whiskey hot nose plenty of rye spice - it is 100% rye - mint bay leaf sweet clove quite a kick but theres good flavor behind it more spice oak and a firm sweetness the finish is quite quick just some dry rye in the back of the mouth and gone better-behaved than most hudson whiskeys ive had hardly mellow but enjoyable price per 375 ml what begins as a banana oat and malt-o-meal delight turns into honey and potato chips this is followed by cookie dough dark cherries sweet-potato chips beets dehydrated pineapple pine nuts and oak its medium finish offers a mouthful of banana if you love banana you ll love this whiskey aged 24 months in these debased times they should be applauded for the correct labeling of this 2 year old somewhat hot nose of grass cinnamon pixy stix powder candy and oak simple sweet on the palate with a crisping of rye bitterness and oak easy-drinking and not overly young color me surprised it s well-made for inexpensive young rye when one imagines the indiana ryes this maximizes every note on the nose warming up with mint dill oak macerated cherries and a ton of baking spices there s a bit of a medicinal palate property in cherry throat lozenge form followed by oak and chocolate its best attribute is an unexpected long finish with a big bite of candied ginger at 95% rye and 5% malted barley it s initially an herbal and floral bomb with slight hints of earth and rising bread dough then cinnamon and lots of it over nutmeg baked apples clove ginger and molasses an explosion of cracked black pepper dominates toward the medium finish with a slight hint of baked pear tasty as a summer sipper or cocktail base the back label of this whiskey describes it as feisty and feisty it is brandishing 95% rye another canadian flavoring whisky that was diverted? bottled at 46% and at a relatively young age around two years old this whiskey lets you know you are alive it s very spicy with crisp evergreen warming cinnamon clove rooty licorice dark chocolate and suggestions of gin botanicals spicy vibrant finish i m having fun drinking this au naturel the whiskey that is but this would also zing in a cocktail the same way smoky islay whiskies make their presence known in a blended scotch value pick the follow-up to 81 proof wild turkey bourbonâand part of a continuing trend by distillers to release versatile whiskey reasonably priced no age statement that will stand out in cocktails but can be enjoyed on its own in a pinch very spicy yet relatively soft in character with suggestions of gin botanicals dried fruits honeyed vanilla and teasing charred oak very quaffable for a rye whiskey peanut taffy licorice black pepper tarragon and lemon vie with popsicle stick and a bit of solvent on the nose the palate is laden with herbsâanise licorice tarragon and basilâas well as cubeb black pepper and cough syrup there are some enjoyable flavors here but heavy-handed oak throws things off-balance in the pantheon of rye whiskey breakout sits at a coveted 8 years old the nose offers its age with a hint of oak over the delicate savory herbal aromas that range from dill to oregano there s a slight vanilla note on the second whiff the palate offers smoke coffee smoked paprika vanilla wafers and a hint of chocolate followed by a medium-length finish making me wish this was just 10 proof points higher sourced whiskey roasted lemon and orange peels grilled apples nutmeg ginger and popsicle stick on the nose citrus-flavored hard candies cinnamon cloves iced tea apple skins and drying wood on the palate which takes water well this is simple wood-forward and immature but the flavors are pleasant total wine & more with spearmint licorice dried flowers cedar and new oak on the nose it s no surprise to taste a wood-forward palate iced tea with orange peel spearmint grain sweet cedar and drying oak lead into a finish of menthol dark cocoa and shoe polish youthful with some rough edges but enjoyable distilled by catoctin creek from 100% rye total wine & more dark hot brown sugar sweet peppermint candy a hot rye burner but moderate on the palate the heats here but the flavors come through clearly in waves of mint sugar oily clove and a brittle sweet finish this is no lapdog but neither is it a clumsy huge puppy theres real rye character the rough spots smoothed off by wood a good young rye clear as cave spring water a mashbill of 70% rye mellowed by charcoal and ignorant of barrel-aging it is white dog-brash fresh wet grain trampled grass and a salty tinge the spirit is pleasurably smooth and cool sweet in body with a bitter film of rye spice a gentlemanly clear spirit that s itching to get into a cocktail my only real complaint is the price this is a taste of what s to come so expect an aged rye to follow chocolate honey vanilla cotton candy smoke from barbecue coals and a big whiff of brown sugar cooking in butter then oak shows softening to vanilla and an explosion of cinnamon nutmeg and allspice you re thinking this is a nice mid-range rye but a short finish really disappoints its finish is saved by a nice hint of dill sourced whiskey youthful in nature and fairly straight-forward fresh minty spice notes accompany some candied citrus fruit and some light toffee what s there is pleasing enough i just wish there was more there in both flavor and depth continuing progress on jack daniel s rye whiskey this one is 2 years old and labeled straight pale amber new make sharpness sawn oak hard candy and a flip of cinnamon bark driven simple insistent nose thin on the palate sweet with an oily overlay of bitter grass and grainy flatness a dry contracting finish not flawed but not particularly pleasant either someone tell jack craft distillers get $50 for young rye because they re small jd should be half that a balanced and well-rounded whiskey but it tastes a little youthful and spirity on the finish and lacks the depth i m looking for to score it higher in the 80s notes of maple syrup crã¨me caramel and raspberry tart with cinnamon vanilla mint and dried citrus peppered throughout i like it but there are better bourbons at this price\r\n",

of peat used along with the youth of this whiskey has a distinct impact of the whiskey s flavor it s sweet and smoky which works well throw in some bacon fat diesel oil smoke like at a boat dock anise ginger honeyed malt barley lime and pear underneath all that peat lies what seems like a fairly young whiskey because it is very brisk and vibrant but not excessively so bonus points for distinctiveness bog oak is oak preserved in irish peat bogs for 5000 years and for this whiskey cask heads made of it are used for maturation the whiskey is 3 year old turf mor only a year older then mixed with some older whiskeys and its intriguing this has all the oily burning dust smoky notes of a standard connemara but the rubbery youthfulness of turf mor is gone and this is sweet with orange notes and a long peaty sweet finish â¬ 250 connemara s wild west coast landscape is a world away from this peated whiskey s production at cooley distillery on ireland s east coast greater smoke than original lemon and fresh cream translate into lemon lozenges and sherbet with tangy tropical fruits and well-balanced smoke lasting throughout the finish straw color in both aroma and flavor the

notes expensive but very lovable the fruitiest of the three notes of ripe fruit candied almonds treacle and toffee dry spicy oak notes on the finish rich and thick in texture but not to the point of being cloying and while the sherry notes are prominent throughout they do not dominate like many other scotch and irish whiskeys it s well balanced and very enjoyable save this one for after dinner an

cotton candy honey and subtle floral notes light in body and somewhat creamy in texture with a soft slightly youthful finish more irish character than previous knappogue bottlings and quite mature for an eight year old whiskey it is a touch youthful on the finish while it is quite enjoyable now and unbelievably drinkable i would like to have seen this whiskey with another one to two years of aging to give it a little more depth and maturity on the finish the newest vintage from knappogue castle and like the past two vintages this one is from bushmills more maturity and oak influence when compared to the 1994 floral with creamy vanilla toasted oak honeyed malt citrus fruit and marshmallow soft creamy finish with delicate oak spice a clean very drinkable whiskey and my favorite of the post-cooley knappogues\r\n",
      " close to one year later than the previous knappogue castle release a 15 year old expression and distinctly different in flavor profile think different distilleries this one triple-distilled suggests bushmills origin very clean and polished gently sweet too with powdered vanilla honeyed malt complex tropical fruit tangerine kiwi coconut pineapple and creamy marshmallow clean gently sweet finish not the most complex irish i ve ever tasted but the flavors that are there are tight and well-balanced tropical in nature with pineapple coconut and kiwi additional notes of vanilla caramel new-mown hay and light marzipan creamy on the palate throughout a lovely whiskey but the two finished versions above have it beat comparatively speaking the aromas of red apple peppercorn baked ham and rowanberry make it the least enticing nose in the tyrconnell range although the port cask endows a beautiful delicate blush to the whiskey s color the mouthfeel is thinner too with red apple watermelon mouth-drawing oak fruit chews and burnt spices in the end a redeeming finish however the gums tingling delightfully with fruit and spice the most northerly of northern ireland s distilleries bushmills ages this spirit in bourbon and oloroso casks before finishing in port wine casks the sweet notes of fat ripe blueberries plum flesh and dusty dry warehouses sketch out the nose it lands on the tongue dry but piquant then the fruit swarms all over it blueberry black currant and apple with hazelnut chocolate pralines black pepper and spice this was once the pick of the range but the port influence seems feistier than older bottlings and i miss how smooth this used to taste cooley produced some great irish single malt whiskeys and this is no slouch either it pulls off the trick of being both very irish with sweet lush pear fermenting apple and yellow fruit notes and of being distinctively a single malt mainly because the barley is held in check by just enough influence of tannin and spice its a bit like a fruit cordial and the oak doesnt overstay its welcome a nice pepper flourish in the finish bernard walsh hand selects the 12 year old whiskey for this bottling using only first-fill bourbon casks the rich tawny color has a nose of caramelizing sugars gingersnaps peanut brittle and stewed fruits of apple and rhubarb rich flavors of butterscotch caramels orange twist oak and that ginger intensity which persists with a slight bitterness there s a big hit of grapefruit as it reaches its zenith before it mellows to a dry nutty conclusion 2200 bottles to be released annually the single grain category gains another brother this was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels finished in spanish oloroso sherry wood before being reduced with wicklow mountain water the nose oozes caramel browned apple grated nutmeg black peppercorn toasted coriander and clove a flash of mint is overtaken by a swath of caramel apple and pear drops orbiting the muscular spice kick of clove pepper and ground chili concentrated on the tongue kapow one to pour blind to talisker lovers 200 years ago kinahan s was the favorite tipple of the lord lieutenant of ireland the

cherry cola black pepper and chili flakes rounded weighty sweet and rolling this just laps up the water dark oily finish with bitter chocolate a single malt you can really get behind the nose on the single malt is spicier than their blend with salted caramels and a smear of honey to boot key to the palate is the fresh fruitiness melon pear and white grape additionally there s honey a hefty malt presence and spices keep things interesting the finish of bruised fruit makes a greater impression at the back of the palate water emphasizes sweetness and blushing summer fruits great quality though it doesn t shout it from the rooftops the connacht whiskey company s first release comes in small bottles but it goes a long way whole lemons yellow plum pine floor cleaner and a light smear of vanilla neat there s a real intensity of lemon-drenched sweet oak with a boiled candy finish but it s much more enjoyable brought down in strength the soft fruits shine it s lemony though less acidic and the barley notes show their best side one of the tastiest sourced whiskeys on the irish market 5000 bottles price is per 375 ml zested lemon pine-scented floor cleaner and quite a grassy proposition with white peach dried flowers perfumed soaps and orange pith it has a slightly soapy mouthfeel with lavender lemon curd vanilla and clove and pepper the spices ramping up the intensity the longer it s held in the mouth clove and bitter lemon on the finish takes you from whimsy to wildness in seconds a peat-smoked malt whiskey from ireland s cooley distillery similar to many smoky scotch whiskies the difference to me is that i don t get as much of the seaweed and coastal notes often found in the scotch whiskies still there is plenty going on in this whisky including a lovely creamy vanilla and honeyed malt underbelly to tame the smoke it reveals more of itself with the addition of water if there were peat-smoked lowland scotch whiskies they might taste like this \r\n",
      " the fifth vintage of knappogue castle and the second consecutive one comprised of whiskey from the bushmills distillery the previous three were from the cooley distillery this one is very clean and quite soft on the palate with a gentle sweetness throughout fresh malt vanilla and honey floral and citrus notes offer a subtle pleasantness throughout soft soothing creamy vanilla finish with hints of confectioners sugar and lightly toasted marshmallow this is a pleasant versatile irish whiskey to have in your bar to serve neat on the rocks or in smart cocktails \r\n",
      " the teelings were responsible for giving us the quite wonderful greenore which moved up the gears until it hit stunning at 15 years old this i suspect is back to the start and is a work in progress but it has all the right parts even if it isnt firing quite yet its nose is industrial and a tad sappy but the taste makes up for it sweet light with smoky ashtrays and almond pulp grandiose name for a perfectly acceptable but ultimately tame and straight-ahead irish whiskey there are hints of pot still oiliness and the expected green fruits are in place but the only new trick on offer here is the fact that it is less sweet and cloying than its brand siblings the apples are like baked apples filled with mincemeat with nutmeg and cinnamon in the mix frustrating in that it hints at greatness but doesnt follow through the walsh family releases 6000 bottles in every small batch of their single malt each bottling is a combination of triple distilled whiskey matured in oloroso sherry and bourbon casks the nose is bright with vanilla icing butterscotch and dried peach the taste is quite active with honey cinnamon gingerbread ground almond and dark chocolate there is a brief flat spot where the bitterness burns through before it fades to leave a pleasing tickle around the gums the oldest release yet under the glendalough name this bourbon cask whiskey brings forth a nose of lush caramels malt milky hot chocolate nutmeg with herbal notes hovering at the periphery the mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth and reassuringly malty after an early spice kick there is grapefruit with mint eventually taking charge fizzy effervescent candies pop on the palate and tongue a medium-length finish the mint diminishing to leave cinnamon and a little charred oak a fine discovery the ryan family has been running the beggars bush pub in dublin since 1913 and historically they bottled their own whiskey this is enticingly sweet from the bourbon wood with taffy candy vanilla cream and peeled orange the warm fruity flavors encompass sweet orange lime and pineapple before a wave of honey and maltiness rides in with an undercurrent of kendal mint cake though the fruit persists satellites of citrus around drying oak make the finish solid composed and decent to stand out in the increasingly crowded marketplace of sourced single malt irish whiskey you need a good original hook this whisky is cut with wicklow water shhh don t tell st kevin the bourbon casks have developed a sweet honeyed nose with fresh hay peach pit and some mature oak characteristics lighter weight than the blend see below it relinquishes golden honey satsuma ground ginger crystal sugar and tame spices pleasantly drinkable and incontestably well-made but the liquid needs greater individuality fresh and grassy it s quite dainty with peach liquorice allsorts and light florals sugary sweetness lemon slices and candied orange jellies concluding with hot white pepper and residual sweetness this is sourced 4 year old grain whiskey finished in port barrels though the label does not disclose this otherwise an original delectable finishing concept de il ma md nj ny pa and washington dc past bottlings were distilled at the bushmills or cooley distilleries excepting the rare original 1951 vintage which was from the old b daly distillery this one is triple distilled so think bushmills cooley distills their whisky twice in the past i ve noticed a lot of flavor development in bushmills from 10 to 12 years old this knappogue 12 year old is a fresh clean smooth irish whisky displaying a nice creamy texture i m finding honeyed vanilla toasted marshmallow and lots of fruit citrus pineapple coconut and peach a soft dry oak finish shores up the sweetness and adds a smattering of spice a pleasant entry-level irish single malt additional note knappogue castle has historically been a whisky with a vintage not an age statement while it will be nice to have some consistency here i will miss the subtle differences that each of the previous vintage offerings provided don t remember ever reading that michael collins suffered from schizophreniaâ¦ this is a bewildering whiskey suffering from an identity crisis its fruity apple irish heart wrapped in wood some peat and conversely some sherbet and sugar-coated almonds it s not unpleasant - far from it - but the journey from sweet apple to sharp spice is a challenge stay with it and ultimately the complexities of the malt win through this first release in the steamship collection was matured in oloroso sherry butts and enticingly smells both oily and jammy dried fruits such as cranberry cherry and raisin with brazil nut oil wood spice and light pepper a soft dram tasting of stewed apple plum cherry jelly spiced orange dark chocolate and ending with spices pepper fading fruit and carob nibs it s not all at sea but just needs more body especially mid-palate to ride the waves of oloroso influence travel retail exclusive â£65 if youve ever tasted connemara peated whiskey youll recognize this as youd expect for an irish whiskey its sweet with overripe apples and some pureed almost creamy pear but thats all offset by a sooty burned-dust smokiness and some gentle spice its quite soft and easy-drinking and the taste is never less than interesting but these days its up against some stiff competition just 6 months in a port pipe have dressed this whiskey with aromas of kola kubes savory spices and meat juices plus the whiff of a damp dog licking your face palate of cherry lips golden delicious apple and a peppery bite it careens toward plum bitter fruit skins and a medicinal ending of aniseed-laced cough syrup like young vintage port this still has more than a few sharp edges prune juice and some fresh cream on the nose the sticky palate delivers flavors of apple juice tangerine and gooseberry the spices get popping growing peppery but despite the ripe fruits it could benefit from more sweetness the long spicy finish is redolent of aniseed throat lozenges it would have been fascinating to taste the unfinished whiskey or a version after a longer sherry finish glendalough s hook is the wicklow water used to cut this whiskey sweet fruits tubby satsumas lime and passion fruit backed by ground ginger star anise and some earthy background notes from the bourbon casks tangy orange crystallized fruits predominate pierced with pepper root ginger and soda pop the mouthfeel is light and uncomplicated but provides a solid delivery of tasty flavors from start to the snappy spicy finish a great introduction first impression is of molten reese s peanut butter cups this 13 year old single grain whiskey has been finished in second-fill red wine casks from ãnima negra in mallorca however this wine cask has given the whiskey a kick in the balearics the grain character takes a drubbing the nose engulfed by jam pots and loganberry it is gentle and deliciously fruity reminiscent of strawberry raspberry pop tarts and citrus groves black pepper and caramelized sugar to close 417 bottlesâ â¬90 a 14 year old unpeated single malt whiskey given the celtic whiskey shop s trademark ãnima negra

laundry there is decent weight and structure here sharp acidity of peel scattered over lemon meringue pie cinnamon black pepper and a finish of creamy fudge dipped in milk chocolate water pries open a hitherto-hidden waxy consistency 6000 bottles released originating from cooley distillery this whiskey spent a decade in a first-fill bourbon cask before a period of extra maturation in a vinhos barbeito madeira cask and the influence is unmistakable on the nose additionally there is vanilla icing brown bananas sprigs of wild mint and a savory note of smoked duck it s a soft buttery experience with honey mandarin guava banana and light spices dry short sweet finish but the madeira tips the balance 377 bottlesâ â¬125 an irish blend matured in used bourbon barrels and finished in concannon petite sirah wine barrels very clean and fresh with mouth-coating honeyed malt vanilla tropical fruit and golden raisin fleeting light oak finish my only issue with this whiskey is that it tastes young i would like to see another four to five years of aging in bourbon casks not sirah for this whiskey to really develop available only in the us cooley distillery s oldest blend to date packaged in what looks like a very large perfume bottle elegant and creamy on the nose with vanilla coconut grass and suggestions of bourbon similar on the palate but more reserved becoming dry on the finish with lingering charred oak i think the slightly austere oaky finish detracts from what otherwise would be a very nice blend the best part of this whiskey is the nose styled as the original moonshine these aromas whisper of sweet summer fruits golden barley and potato farls there is no lightning bolt of alcohol sipping at 40% abv but it is smooth and pleasantly tasty flavors of melon apple and sugared biscuits finishing with a barley tickle around the gums a versatile addition to your cocktail armory from west cork distillers of skibbereen but i found it lost much of its appeal poured over ice a 10 year old single malt whiskey bottled for pete st john by glendalough musters a low-key olfactory range with reference points of malted barley sawn oak and soft fudge a woozy haze of toffee buttercream vanilla and clotted cream hang on a light structure the flavor has limited room to maneuver roaming around a palate of sponge cake fudge fingers and ginger snaps before it putters out with a dry fleeting finish û60 as the enterprising fellows at west cork distillers only built the place in 2007 this 10 year old must be sourced elsewhere a decent nose with vanilla cupcakes fresh from the oven dull lemon notes tablet and faint spices it has a limited range let down by a narrow flavor profile acidic lemony sharpness with a light mouthfeel the sharpness strong-arms the sugariness for 30 seconds until toffee notes break through an acerbic lemon bonbon in liquid form its great that irish whiskey is thriving and william grant has bought tullamore dew but they need help to paraphrase english football fans someone doesnt know what hes doing the label says this is 12 years old small batch and limited edition what? the normal whiskey is a blend and theres no distillery so what is this and why small batch? the whiskeys a mess too ñ flabby characterless and confused ñ the whiskey equivalent of a karaoke singer doing led zeppelin compass box takes a fresh approach to flavored whisky by infusing navalino oranges and spices into a blend of highland single malt and single grain whisky bright and slightly bitter orange peel combines with vanilla honey and malt the grain whisky gives nice support and structure along with black pepper cinnamon and clove spice great balance between the whisky and flavoring in a flavored whisky that is much more dry than sweet finally a flavored whisky to get really excited about hugely different from the standard drambuie much more dryly herbal and the whiskys right here in the noseand yet they are distinctly related in the base character of the herbs the whisky is quite present - 15 year old speyside malts shine like the sun on rippling water - but the flavors of drambuie are clear as well still sweet but the whisky is much more the star a drambuie for us? intriguing herbalmedicinal nose with notes of pepper grass dried hay dried flowers orange peel and licorice sweet but lively and light on the palate as the orange explodes and the whisky boldly appears wrapped in honey and herbs the finish is herbal and sweet as the whisky strolls off into the distance overall quite complex and rewarding booze candy from beam? more like bacon in a glass the sweet smokiness invaded my dining room definitely the last tasting of the day richly smoky-sweet with a clear balance of maple over corn like a rustic breakfast of bacon pancakes and whiskey the maple s restrained and authentic the 45% keeps it from being too sweet and there s plenty of good bourbon flavor here especially at the finish lush tasty if you have to do flavors here s how tons of vanilla and sweet custard in the nose enough to make the mouth water and not fake-smelling at all once again the 40% makes a difference light and sweet in the mouth like a glass of creme brulee eau de vie id enjoyed the sweet vanilla-spice character so much that the whisky slipping in at the end was almost a shock but its there and even adds a bit of mint and fire embarrassingly tasty kerrygold is ireland s major player in the dairy business scored against other irish cream liqueurs this is highly rated i m smitten the sweet chocolate is rich delectable and utterly gorgeous with melting caramels slathered all over the taste buds riding high on a wave of lush irish cream there are fruity notes of sultana and black cherry expressed by the chocolate which soar above the reliable foundation of irish whiskey can you tell this won my heart? do indulge with a rich nose like warm maple syrup it s hard to miss that this is a flavored whisky but the maple smells real like breakfast in a vermont diner it s also good that it s not sickly sweet and thick the mouthfeel is like good crown with maple flavor not a big wad of syrup so if you like flavored whiskies bring on the canadian cocktails and ice cream this is the good stuff finger lakes distilling rye whiskey infused with catskill mountains honey the nose is grassy oily rye whiskey and the honey s there mostly as a rounder richer character enhancer it s much more present in the mouth merging very nicely indeed with the rye there s authentic delicious honey flavor here and it s balanced beautifully as the rye keeps it from being sticky or oversweet an excellent and interesting flavored whiskey up there with the best examples of the category a rye-fueled horse-drawn sleigh ride to a backwoods quebec sugar shack springs instantly to mind vanilla toasted wood brittle maple snow taffy and the woody crystalline granularity of maple sugar in a velvety smooth whisky base hot pepper wood smoke and green maple bark fold into a steaming cauldron of whisky barrel notes the first few days  maple syrup is the richest and that alone is what blender michel marcil uses for this ultra-premium maple whisky quebec only dang c$50 ginger may not be the first flavor that leaps to mind when you think flavored whiskey but then you realize how common the combination is jack and ginger jameson and ginger and now virgil kaine fresh ginger is unmistakable on the nose and the secret to this whiskey s success on the palate fresh ginger seamlessly integrates with oak black pepper and clove spice underneath is sweet vanilla that helps keep everything in balance a well-executed and savvy flavored whiskey insistent honey nose with whisky underneath the honey is very forward but still floral and light fresh flavor is pleasant floral faintly herbal and more honey but again light and fresh not cloying not heavy there s a hint of citrus in the finish and then finally there is a slightly sticky character not something a single malt drinker would likely reach for but a respectable entry in the field of flavored whisky most flavored whiskeys start with an existing whiskey and add flavoring but bushel & barrel comes at it from the other end mixing berentzen s apple liqueur with a kentucky bourbon bright crisp apple cider defines the opening while in the mid-palate subtle bourbon notes emerge with vanilla honey cinnamon and light oak the bourbon notes complement the sweet apple cider and help keep things from getting too sweet bourbon and cider have always been buddies and they do quite well together here a judicious infusion of vanilla and spice bolsters cinnamon pepper caramel and aged oak while leaving the rye whisky character intact prune juice tinged with citrus fruit balances sour black licorice and earthy artist s canvas the palate has a creaminess but with pithy silky tannins burning hot cinnamon hearts and syrupy sweetness take us vaguely into liqueur territory a complex nose but a simple palate that soon fades into white grapefruit and a warming peppery glow canada only c$26 true to its name the nose is exactly red hots candy along with a touch of corn underneath the entry is soft cinnamon but it quickly ramps up to fiery red hots candy the proofing here matches the flavor precisely for a pleasantly spicy but not overly fiery mid-palate the finish is short and cleans up well with light lingering cinnamon left behind a good balance of sweet and spicy and a solid offering for the genre chopped vanilla beans were added to barrels of bowman bourbon in varying amounts the barrels were married after 24 months and bottled the nose has soft vanilla and sweet orange its almost soothing balm-like vanilla is not at all overpowering in the mouth but shows more as a richness around the edges otherwise a good sprightly bourbon with a nice citrus and oak finish like to try this in a cocktail appropriately caramel-colored the smell of caramel and taffy pushes out of the glass but as you get closer there s the fresh green snap of clear corn whiskey laced through it like fruit in your dessert with an authoritative boozy crack to it nothing s overpowering on the palate - a swirling balanced ride of sweet candy fresh corn and estery booze - but the finish sings a clear pure note ofâ¦salted caramel this could teach flavored vodkas a thing or two the aroma is rich with pumpkin pie notes and a strong citrus component there s eight tons of actual pumpkin in the year s run of this seasonal impressive and you can smell the roasted gourd the whiskey s not sickly sweet as feared but more like a homemade sugarless pumpkin pie almost savory the flavor is solid rich and integrates well for what it is it s done well and it s done boldly i d maybe back off the orange a bit according to the maple syrup geeks who make sortilã¨ge quebec s sugar maple forests produce their sweetest woodiest most robust flavors in the early days of the late-winter syrup season this maple whisky is proof positive creamy sweet slightly peppery leafy in a good way and richly imbued with woodsy maple sortilã¨ge stays firmly in the whisky camp though just downwind from the sugar shack like maple syrup itself it leaves the palate slowly price is per 375 ml quite a bit darker than most other whisky creams chocolate and caramelâon the burnt side an interesting differenceâin the nose with a sly hint of whisky behind it sweet and creamy a bit clingy with just a sting of whisky somewhat generic though because that interesting dark caramel is in the nose only and i d like this to be a bit more distinctive more forty creek still pleasant enough for booze candy c$29 nose is full of a wonderful authentic maple syrup smell with a warming background of whisky the maple s there in the mouth too not overwhelming and blending well with the whisky there s a good balance here for what it is and the finish is clean if you like maple this is going to do it it s not cloying or thick and could make a great cocktail with - really - bacon more widely available than buffalo trace s adored bourbon cream prichard s takes premium cream from wisconsin and adds it to their sweet lucy liqueur the nose is sweet but not overly so with orange creamsicle and just a hint of whiskey with oak spice on the palate it s creamy confection bliss with ladyfingers covered in heavy cream and candied orange topped with a drizzle of bourbon rich creamy but not too heavy file this one as a dangerously delicious guilty pleasure malt whiskey and honey flip back and forth in the nose so precisely balanced my nose doesn t seem to know what to make of it light and a bit frisky in the mouth and the honey is more a grace note than a strong presence though it does come in more in the finish not overly sweet not heavy but it s hard to see the honey as a real game-changer smells like sweet dead-ripe cherries mashed up in bourbon with some brown sugar and just a dust of cinnamon its sweet a bit thick but 80 proof warming and the bourbon - the beam cinnamon note comes out clearer now - is dominant over the cherries here the finish sees more cinnamon even a hint of barrel oak and manages to dry out a bit located in the heart of vermont s syrup belt saxtons river distillery makes both a vermont maple-flavored rye and a maple-flavored bourbon whiskey the rye is the better of the two and does a solid job of mixing oak cinnamon black pepper and rye spice notes with vanilla and rich maple syrup the rye whiskey is a little young but the maple syrup complements it well and is more companion than cover of all the flavors you d expect to see in the moonshine space coconut is probably the last stillhouse s coconut moonshine has a coconut cream nose with a touch of milk chocolate that s actually inviting on the palate it s creamy chocolatey coconut with just a hint of corn whiskey the mid-palate lacks some structure with only a touch of spice the finish is also a little muted but damn if they didn t make a coconut moonshine that isn t horrid spice nose but some alcohol notes put a hot twist to it a blast of baking spices - nutmeg anise allspice mace - hits the palate along with shots of citrus and vanilla that take a while to get organized and settled down leading to a sweet finish where the orange dominates if spicebox is a fireside drink this is a snowy woods outdoors drink a bit hotter more rustic more rough canadian whisky is sweeter to start with and so may well be a natural base for flavors it certainly seems that way with this underpriced example the nose is like restrained caramel candy a fairly deep note of toasted sugar the drink itself is sweet but doesn t cling and is crying for a bit of fizz or some ice cream to drape itself over not bad at all for the price following in the footsteps of bushmills irish honey castle brands tries their hand at a light and sweet irish whiskey-based liqueur strong clover honey dominates with caramel vanilla bean cinnamon and a little ginger spice hard to get to the base whiskey through all the sweet notes but that seems to be the point just short of cloying this is a whiskey-based liqueur for those more interested in the liqueur than the whiskey william grant s answer to drambuie is a much less sweet and higher proof irish whiskey-based liqueur monster caramel leaps out of the glass with an undercurrent of cola caramel leads to chocolate on the palate before malt and grain whiskey undertones emerge mid-palate is a little hot but it helps cut through the underlying sweetness and also features some botanicals like juniper and black pepper clearly a mixing spirit and probably best thrown into a cola or ginger ale rye whiskey aged in casks used to age maple syrup as penetrating an aroma as maple is it s very subtle here the nose is rye whiskeyâspicy oily bittermintyâwith just the barest hint of maple the maple peeps up mid-palateâ for a sweet turn and lingers into the finish i need to be convinced of the attraction the maple and rye jar a bit when jammed together and the priceâ$82 for 750 mlâseems crazy price is per 375 ml a sweet mã©lange of bourbon honey ladyfingers and praline in the nose with a faint thread of heavy tree blossoms quite sweet but not syrupy and the aromas - minus the blossoms - are here plus vanilla some stickiness on the finish but it s not unpleasant more like candy which is what this experience is like booze candy that candy simplicity is confusing there are a lot of flavors here but at a candy level a bit less sweetness would be welcome pink cotton candy and hot caramel sauce on a simple nose turn to rich burnt toffee and invigorating hot chili pepper on the palate followed by savory herbs the herbal tones quickly turn pleasantly bitter before fading into the barest suggestion of dry oak tingling peppery heat lingers right to the end a hot spicy version of wiser s deluxe with the rye elements boosted by added vanilla canada only c$28 burnt caramel sweetâalmost candiedâbut not cloying the whisky quickly develops fiery blasts of pepper that linger long on the sides of your tongue as the heat builds caramel melts into barley sugar which in turn fades into bitter citrus pith flinty hard rye and vague barrel tones never let us forget that this is whisky whisky enhanced with vanilla and spices that a probing palate might have found anyway in the unflavored dram canadian mist with flavor and sweetener boozy but fresh peach vanilla and sugar nose smells like a fresh juicy peach cobbler wheres the whisky? very much dessert-like in the mouth sweet full but not cloying points for that finish is peach candies vanilla and finally some whisky notes even at 35% id like a lot more whisky character here otherwise whats the point? still head and shoulders above southern comforts flavor experiments black bottle cocked-fist logo sourced whiskey infused with green tea hibiscus eucalyptus fennel gingko and more smells schnapps-ish bright floral and woodsy notes with a medicinal twang quite sweet but not sticky the herbs keep it perky the whiskey is tamped down by the sweet and infusion the finish gets even more medicinal i d like less sweet and more whiskey not sure who the market is for this but it makes a tasty add to tea prichard s double barreled bourbon is flavored with artisan chocolate this dark chocolate is clear on the nose but not singular as its accompanied by strong oak maple syrup and cherry on the palate chocolate becomes more a supporting flavor for classic bourbon notes of oak maple caramel and clove spice the mid-palate is a little acidic and the chocolate adds a slight bitterness to the equation the finish is a little too dry but in all an intriguing combination of flavors a subtle essence of vanilla and restrained crispy oak are lathered in rich butterscotch then seasoned with scorching pepper and a pinch of rye spices surprisingly it s not overly sweet smooth creamy custard coats your mouth mellowing otherwise assertive spices the dram finishes in pulling citrus pith with touches of peppery heat tingling ginger and cloves and fading hints of ripe cherries faint but distinct whiffs of barrels remind us that this colorless liquid is whisky alberta only c$40 even though it has more alcohol than southern shine s straight moonshine  the nose is fairly evasive with subtle cinnamon apple the entry is much sweeter than expected with caramel cinnamon and apple but manages to be well-balanced by the base spirit which adds pepper spice and enhances the cinnamon the apple notes flirt with artificiality but end up reading as dried apple the finish is long and maintains the cinnamon-apple spice well but is a tad hot an odd roaring noseful of spices vanilla pepper ginger teaberry tastes perfumey first then resolves to sweet vanilla hot oak and more teaberry can t decide if it wants to be bourbonâit s hot and flexing oakâor candy and does a poor job at both it s like a linebacker in a french maid s outfit just wrong there are much better sweet spicy whiskey mixes out there the original spicebox comes to mind sweet heavy vanilla powdered sugar and dog-toothed spring violets it smells very light with soft hints of sweet floral perfume what begins as viscous and creamy on the tongue suddenly becomes refreshingly bitter and loaded with hot singeing spices pepper and dried candied orange peel linger while the sweetness dims a pleasing bitter finish fades into a warm glow although the whisky struggles at first it breaks through in the middle with its spices and heat canada only c$31 root beer wintergreen sugar a bit of cinnamon and oak on the nose whiskeyoak predominates there s actually a lot of whiskey flavor here too though it s not great whiskey the finish gets sweet and clingy and the mix seems forced stillâ¦root beer-flavored whiskey? in an aluminum bottle? why not just buy some whiskey and put it in your root beer? then when you come to your senses you can drink the whiskey like a civilized human lemony pine woods even some seashore aromas over the sweetness of the malt whiskey underneath not overly bitter more whiskey-sweet and the aromas are subdued in the mouth i like a big hoppy ipa but this isn t setting my palate i think it s missing the body of a beer i have yet to have a hopped whiskey that i really like this isn t it either this literally tastes like pan-fried mushrooms and roots it s earthy you don t really expect such intensity from a flavored whiskey after earth hops chocolate and root beer i finally taste the whiskey a nearly absent sensation toward the end but i guess that s the point if they wanted you to taste whiskey they wouldn t flavor it still there are no chemically-imbalanced flavors here this is worth trying even for us curmudgeon purists it certainly is cinnamon got a nose full of it and not red hots either this is real cinnamon just missing the depth of vietnamese and with yes a bit of whisky there theres next to no whisky in the mouth though this is like a cup of sweet cinnamon tea something id add whisky to too sweet too cinnamon wheres the whisky? warm maple caramel and salt in the nose like caramels being melted for making cookies something my wife does every christmas thin boozy maple in the mouth disappointing though i suppose it would be good in desserts or on desserts but i really expect more whisky even in a flavored whisky under 40% the first thing out of the glass is bourbon - 80 proof bottlings will do that - followed by a secondary note of strong-brewed tea with a dollop of honey its quite sweet and hot and the tea largely disappears except as a frill around the edges this is more a honey drink than a tea drink and there are better honey drinks out there a medicinal cherry smell like cough syrup and cherry pez edged with a nutty hint of almonds medium-bodied a slow-flow on the tongue the cherry doesn t taste real like red stag s does and the soco sweetness doesn t help that there is a pickup at the end as the spirit seems to evaporate off the tongue i can t help thinking that this should have been a slam-dunkâ¦but they missed faint spice aroma becomes more apparent after sitting for 20 minutes initial pour smelled much like the reserve cherry see below christmas cookie spices thick and sweet spice is more evident not bad but pretty thick and not much bourbon flavor for 45% given the beam house character of cinnamon i thought this was redundant till i got a whiff of the sweet cinnamon coming off this like a tea made from red hots candies the drink itself is thickly sweet and more of the hot cinnamon candy overwhelms anything else the bourbon is largely lost here if anything the finish is even more heavy-handed based on the hayes parker bourbon faint cherry aroma not sure i d pick it out without the label s help quite sweet but still the cherry character is not so much subtle or faint as just not there there is some sweet cherry candy character at the very end disappointing when they say berry they mean berries baskets of blueberries blackberries and raspberries until suddenly the palate veers off into grape popsicles this is one sweet unabashedly faux-fruity potation but other than traces of oak not much whisky flavor remains still in the right hands it could be a lot of cocktail fun rather than serving it in a whisky glass a dram or two on french vanilla or coconut-milk ice cream is genuinely scrumptious cinnamon hearts very sweet and crazy hot with cinnamon the cinnamon so dominates this liqueur-like drink that very little whisky manages to peek through until the very end of a long murderously hot finish even then cinnamon overrides the whiskyness leaving a drink rather than a dram fun yes great fun and almost certainly a bracing shooter but it may be difficult to convince the whisky aficionado to think of this as whisky early trial batches of this whisky flavored by cold infusion tasted like sweet roasted squash however the final version that we have here is as inviting as the nutmeg-laced pumpkin pie it so resembles sweet vanilla and salt water taffy fill the air with rummy christmas eggnog taking up the rear unusual in that it s sweet but not syrupy hot pepper lingers as do sweet tingling spices but the whisky notes just barely show their presence canada onlyâ c$22 cinnamon is reputed to have medicinal qualities but you can bet those who drink catch fire cinnamon do so for the incinerating jolt of sweet spicy heat cinnamon hearts and hints of grain dust almost like those cinnamon sticks in christmas punch sweet but not cloying a creamy mouthfeel and touch of whisky wood remind us if vaguely that catch fire is whisky the lynne truss of flavored whiskies shoots winces and leaves with a long glowing finish artificial cherry aroma like cherry pez and barely a hint of bourbon the taste is not overpoweringly sweet at all a surprise and theres a nutty almost luxardo-like character in the cherry that would be more interesting if it werent for the soapy notes and bitter medicinal flavor of the whiskey a more natural cherry character would net a higher rating one of the most popular flavored whiskies today is fireball cinnamon so it s no surprise that other cinnamon whiskies are entering the market this one has a lovely woody cinnamon nose that bursts into sweet blistering cinnamon on the palate cinnamon is a natural whisky flavor but here rather than complement the underlying whisky it completely masks it this is a cinnamon liqueur and a good one a fun shooter perhaps but it s barely whisky spiced apple cider on the nose is a little more spice than cider with strong cinnamon nutmeg and allspice baked apple is there on the opening but it doesn t take long for the spices to take over especially the cinnamon which dominates the cinnamon here leans more toward red hots than cinnamon stick and by the time we get to the finish it has completely conquered this spirit may have been better labeled spicy cinnamon apple pie moonshine real maple syrup has an earthy woodsy aroma maple flavoring has strong overtones of coconut and so does cabin fever the nose evokes dried sweetened baking coconut while the sweet and spicy palate is a hot liquid coconut macaroon peppery notes suggest that it s whisky but without any traces of barrel aging that s as close as you get best part? the long spicy finish with its confection-sweet coconut all of the elements that work with southern shine s apple pie bottling don t work with their blueberry an extremely evasive nose leads to an artificially-flavored palate here the blueberry tastes more like flavored bubblegum than fruit the white pepper from the base spirit clashes with the berry like a multi-car pileup the finish is hot too dry and a little sour there s just nothing about this that s pleasant or enjoyable the aromas from the base rye moonshine complement the apple much better here than in freedom s other flavored offerings baked apple mixes with cinnamon and is supported by a bread undertone the apple note comes off as just a little too artificial like the other freedom moonshine products the entry is too soft and flat the biggest problem here clearly is the proof there s just not enough structure to do anything with this moonshine mix ice or otherwise enjoy does a nose of bright bubble gum and fresh-cut peppers touched by the fermented heat of tabasco sound good? it comes bursting out of the glass with this one busy and hot the taste hits first with the bubble gum blast sweet and light even quickly pleasant until the pepper breaks in twisting and warping this liqueur with a whirl of sweet hot bitter vegetal flavors that turns to a sticky-sweet heat in the finish a regrettably bad idea this flavored moonshine smells like a mass of wet used tea bags underneath is some faint lemon honey and black pepper but it s hard to get to it through the tea entry is strong oversteeped tea which only gets stronger more tannic and more bitter in the mid-palate syrupy lemon honey tries and fails to balance this oversteeped mess finish is long bitter slightly hot and unpleasant do not attempt to drink without copious amounts of crushed ice monarch the 75th

but i am reaching here the similarity is a good thing because i really enjoy the original expression keeping in mind that no two barrels are exactly alike your decision to purchase the single barrel might just come down to whether you want to pay a little more for a higher strength version and whether knowing that it might taste a little different than the standard small batch bottling excites you this is a stylish big broad-shouldered bourbon with a thick sweet foundation nutty toffee pot still rum maple syrup peppered with spice cinnamon but also vanilla and evergreen and dried fruit dry warming resinous finish incidentally i would rate the small batch within a point or two and the tasting notes would be very similar surprisingly reserved on the oak spice it tastes like a bourbon half its age soothing in nature with layers of sweetness honey vanilla cream caramel nougat lively complex fruit coconut pineapple ripe peach honeydew melon and gentle cinnamon soft creamy finish a whiskey that has aged very gracefully delicious this is a single barrel every barrel is unique here a perfect harmony delivers crã¨me brã»lã©e butterscotch fruit cinnamon and rising cornbread right away complexity sets in delivering salted baked almonds cashews dried apricot pistachio gelato nutter butters salted caramel popcorn rye toast with brown sugar butter and sugarcane somehow a drop of water makes it even more complex amplifying the butterscotch and presenting cinnamon-soaked roasted pecans and almonds pure bliss a must-sip as bourbon matures in new charred oak barrels over time it approaches a perilous point when the oak dominates the flavor to sip elijah craig at 12 years of ageâat full barrel proof without dilution or filteringâis to taste bourbon at its apex so dangerously close to going over the crest of the hill yet delivering a massive mouthful of incredibly robust flavors that drape leathery oak over a gooey caramel core sprinkled with baking spice while candied nuts and tobacco leaf notes appear on a drying finish dusted with cocoa number 1 in the 2017 top 20â \r\n",

and molasses an intriguing whiskey and my favorite of the three each of these three bourbons was distilled and bottled at the same time and aged in the same warehouse for 12 years and 3 months the main variable was the floor they were aged on in theory the higher up in the warehouse the greater the temperature variation and the more wood influence does the experiment support this general concept? yes with the sweet spot being the middle floor\r\n",

sweetish whiskey -- not cloying in any way in fact it s very drinkable and it s a whiskey that demonstrates great harmony between youth and maturity aged slightly more than 9 years the annual single barrel releases jumped last year from approximately 10 years old to 9 years old with both a 2005 and 2006 vintage released in the same year a mã©lange of fruit apricot candied citrus pineapple golden

cinnamon-forward finish stagg is so smooth it s quite drinkable at higher proofs on the other hand when you bring it down to the strength that you would normally drink your whiskey it s almost too easygoing i made the same comment about last year s william larue weller bottling the main theme to this whiskey is lush toffee sweetness and like last year s expression some vanilla fudge nougat and molasses underlying notes of dates tobacco dark berried fruit spearmint and a hit of coffee round out the palate given the higher strength it s a true value bourbon -- almost like getting two bottles in one a very nice whiskey but when brought down to comparable strength the eagle rare 17 has more complexity tennessee whiskey shall not be undersold in this flavorful version rich notes of caramel

cherry candied nuance smoke caramel french toast vanilla and apricot but then an explosion of marzipan coats the palate with vanilla freshly baked rye bread and hints of brown sugar nutmeg toasted almond and bittersweet chocolate finally cherry cola and herbs walk you to a lovely long bitter finish with warm undertones this is a year-round front porch sipper this is sure to be a divisive edition but once you open your mind to the idea it s hard to argue with the titillating aromas and seductive sweetness that curaã§ao casks bring resembling a bourbon liqueur the nose is replete with tangerine orange peel tropical fruit and nougat the palate circles back to classic bourbon notes that manage to find balance with the candied orange nose think carnival aromasâthe good ones anywayâmeeting the campfire cracker jacks cinnamon-covered almonds popcorn cotton candy marshmallows melting over graham crackers and hints of smoldering oak next coconut caramel and cocoa over a buttery mouthfeel with hints of toffee banana baked apple and pumpkin pie appear toward the end hints of black pepper and raspberry strudel surface in a medium to long finish initially it s a nut-filled experience with toasted walnuts pecans and brazil nuts but an atypical spice appears that s just lovely smoked hatch chiles mingle with rounded notes of cinnamon crã©me brã»lã©e bananas foster orange canned peaches caramel chew and toffee the pepper spices reappear for a grand finish an exciting blend of straight rye whiskeys finished in french oak and port barrels beautifully spiced warming cinnamon crisp mint tamed by caramel and vanilla fudge red and black raspberry plum dried citrus and wood shavings add complexity warming finish nicely balanced and very distinctive distillery only until october 1st then nationally distilled in 2010 this is always the youngest whiskey in the collection and is younger than last year s release i feel this is a slight liability as it comes across a bit green and harsh for a handy bold and spicy with mint clove and cinnamon leading the way fig caramel and candied fruit round out the palate but its youthfulness supersedes on the finish one of the weaker offerings of handy buffalo trace antique collection 2016 this is original red wax maker s mark that received additional aging in barrels containing internal seared french oak staves the original maker s mark being a wheated bourbon instead of rye which is typically used is rather mellow and easy-to-drink the french oak staves in 46 add firm complex dry spices led by warming cinnamon followed by nutmeg and clove herb a suggestion of green chartreuse perhaps? and some polished leather grip which dovetails well with maker s trademark layered sweetness caramel vanilla a hint of honey i m also picking up some dried fruit in the background the seared oak stave influence is somewhat aggressive but never to the point of being excessive knob was one of the first bourbons i had when i started taking whiskey seriously and it s still a kicker no-nonsense flint-hard nose slickly-polished oak furniture cinnamon stick cracked rye wet cornmeal hard candies bang a lean whiskey that gets in your mouth and explodes with rye spice and cinnamon candy a sharp wedge that opens you right up the finish echoes oak a dying fire clean and almost crisp emphatic bright and swift value pick when the caramel train comes it rarely returns after such strong earthy notes of roots hay and soil it s the same story in the next round first pan-fried sweet potatoes and parsnips dominate caramel returns with vanilla allspice and white pepper then the odd but welcomed combo of campfire-smoked marshmallows and gingersnaps just before a long caramel finish very unique the folks at angel s envy once again push the envelope with this 95% rye whiskey finished in caribbean rum casks vibrant spicy rye notes cinnamon and mint are tamed by rich maple syrup graham cracker crust nutty toffee candy floss subtle tropical fruit and creamy vanilla warm spicy rummy finish this is a mood whiskeyânot one i would drink every dayâbut the flavors marry nicely and the sweetness tames this high-testosterone rye whiskey bonus points for uniqueness editors choice the angel s envy cask strength port cask finished bourbon has developed a cult following and it s easy to see why jumping out are marshmallow caramel vanilla roasted nuts with a hint of cardamom coffee and nutmeg but true beauty lies in the pronounced pumpkin pie dark chocolate raw pine nut caramel and sweet maltiness i d love for this whiskey to finish longer but it does give a hint of nutmeg toward the end sourced whiskey initially it s extremely perfume-like with floral notes often found in fragrances then the fruit completely takes over banana blueberry plums cherry apple pear and quince of these the banana lingers until chocolate and vanilla enter the picture followed by hints of green pepper and graham cracker then boom baking spices launch into a lovely medium to long finish a bold nose smacks of sweetness and deep layers of leathery oak and toasted nuts the palate pours sweet initially with earthy dried apples citrus and bread crust before the bitter citrus pith and tobacco notes rush in turning dry and tannic with tea leaves dried herbs and cigar wrapper finals wisps of varnish are a hallmark of age this elder statesman deserves respect but is nonetheless past its prime yes 23 years is a long time to age bourbon and yes there s plenty of oak influence but there s an underlying sweetness that balances the oak spice with this particular cask others may vary chewy in texture with toffee dates fig cake with nuts barrel char tobacco leather and a dusting of cocoa rich and bold it s loaded with caramel notes that range from macchiato to salted caramel chews then complexity sets in with brown sugar vanilla cake batter cinnamon-dusted molasses cookies candied pecans brown-sugar butter and cornbread the key here is that each note appears with that initial caramel richness and follows this to the long warm and satisfying finish with a hint of spice distilled at buffalo trace in kentucky but aged mostly in virginia at the a smith bowman distillery this is a bold hearty bourbon not elegant or refined rather a bit mean and moody at times sweeter gentler notes of vanilla caramel nougat mocha and candied fruit wrestle with more aggressive tobacco leather and damp forest floor notes warming cinnamon-tinged gripping finish a rewarding whiskey for those with an adventurous soul aged then finished in bowman barrels that held hardywood park brewery gingerbread stout in between a beautifully spicy bourbonâbut not aggressively soâwith cinnamon clove and nutmeg the spice is

up in sunset light and just enjoy the russet and amber hues reflecting sweetness savory and floral fragrances followed by brown sugar fresh-baked rye bread and malt caramel and vanilla with roasted pine nuts and spice and a slight hint of strawberry lead to a long and savory finish balance is the point of this sipper the third taylor release and the gentlest most even-keeled of the three black raspberry mulberry maple syrup oak resin dates soft leather and spice mint cinnamon clove vanilla round out the palate very drinkable for 100 proof and with plenty of character if you wondered when you saw 50% this is indeed bottled in bond whiskey with all the requirements that go with it the nose is just this side of hot and brings parched corn sawn maple wood spicy hard candy and dry spearmint leaf bright and spicy on the tongue more candy and honey and hints of teaberry and licorice that develop into the finish a better package of flavor and price than the earlier taylor releases quite enjoyable the barrel staves used to age this whiskey dried outside in the open for 13 months the oak influence is certainly evidentâboth from the cured oak staves and from the fact that the whiskey is 17 years oldâbut never overpowers plentiful spice notes especially cinnamon and vanilla are tamed by lovely sweetness toffee dates nougat and energized by bright fruit long dry warming finish one of the better taylors this whiskey s mashbill includes both rye and wheat most bourbons contain one or the other and usually it s rye the sweet inviting mellowness of the wheat is there so is the spicy zing of the rye look for creamy caramel and soft vanilla peppered with fresh mint and warming cinnamon firm oak grip on the finish with lingering spice dynamic and invigorating hot barrel

bourbon with an unusually high percentage of rye in the mashbill it shows with vibrant notes of warming cinnamon fresh mint nutmeg licorice root and a hint of tellicherry pepper all this is soothed by vanilla caramel and subtle honeyed citrus lively distinctive and versatile redolent of marshmallow and vanilla this is restrained on the nose but revels in pretty sweetness with peaches and cream ripe

a bit hot on the palate with plenty of oak tannins making it a nice sipper on the rocks or with water value pick there s no age statement but this wheated bourbon is about 10 years old this is the

proof never shows but the medium finish is just a touch short to make this truly special new hampshire only at first it s a smorgasbord of cotton candy vanilla caramel tapioca pudding honey and salted

turn on the palate roasted corn dark chocolate honey syrup mashed cherry caramel scotch ale and cinnamon smoked cherrywood hickory milk chocolate strawberry preserves orange peel and peach cobbler what were once multiple fruit flavors now become a single cherry turnover with a sprinkle of cinnamon it finishes medium with cherry soft elegant and nicely rounded with honeyed orchard fruit and gentle spice on a bed of vanilla and caramel very versatile a pleasing unchallenging bourbon to suit most moods and situations i actually like it better than the new older 10 year old expression reviewed in this issue because it is so beautifully balanced a solid basic bourbon with pure sweetness honey marzipan and wildflower notes the sweet drive is nicely backed with drying oak on the pronounced finish like sucking on a sweet and woody cherry popsicle stick a simple and enjoyable crowd pleaser and smaller sibling to the barrel proof our 2017 whisky of the year pineapple rings lemon and orange wedges and brown sugar aromas offset fresh pine and a bundle of herbs basil tarragon fennel the chewy palate is herbal and savory with licorice dark chocolate roasted cherry and plenty of oak yielding to pineapple orange and lemon on the finish the bump-up in proof from its non-bonded sibling bourbon yields nice results when adding water which softens and expands the flavors triple

bourbon â tennessee straight bourbon whiskey believed to be from dickel but no confirmation just the huge cracked corn component in the nose which should be all you need my that s tasty as it

tennessee whiskey definition squabbles sourced whiskey a nose like big red gumâjuicy-sweet cinnamonâand some sweet dough with sharp alcohol heat hot as expected on the tongue but exciting more cinnamon and sweetnessâlike snickerdoodlesâwith wet corn a touch of bitter oil and hot spearmint adding water eases the heat and brings out the oak good stuff if a bit simple sourced whiskey less driving aroma than batch 005â lower floor? both are a mashbill of 70264% cornryemalt more corn and cinnamon and bread dough in the nose here a lot like 005 but more sweet cornmeal less spice less height in the mouth and the finish is sweeter and longer might be that farmer s younger brother this one s only 8 years old still good a bit less complex sourced whiskey 5 years is when bourbon really starts developing complexity and you find the beginnings of greatness here with saltwater taffy vanilla custard citrus corn pudding and a healthy dose of cinnamon its proof offers satisfying warmth that quickly turns to spice medium finish gracefully gives a hint of warm vanilla icing in an age of barrel strength bourbons this is a good one but lacks complexity for higher praise sourced whiskey starting with floral fruit and perfume notes its prominent bouquet barely allows the undertones of honeysuckle spice and oak to shine through on the palate honey canned peaches tobacco and crã¨me brã»lã©e lead the way just before an explosion of vanilla layers the palate in the form of cake batter icing and a white fudge-dipped oreo however bitterness sets in causing a slight unbalance and lingers toward the medium finish slow-roasted corn marzipan cinnamon nutmeg and kettle corn start this experience and slowly fade to corn on the cob with butter salt and pepper then it s apple cider vinegar deep-fried mushrooms and nutella fried pie dough and hints of chocolate appear before a medium finish that has a hint of toffee initially floral and fruit meet oak and a cadre of baking spices then it s a plethora of vanilla in several forms from icing to pudding followed by notes of butterscotch fudge oreo cookies and pecan shell sweet cigar tobacco and honey follow this home to a short to medium finish with a hint of peach cobbler ideal for cocktails sweet and smoke open this interesting whiskey that bounces from sweet to savory throughout vanilla and caramel meet burnt oak and charcoal smoke followed by cinnamon nutmeg and a lot of coffee hazelnut and salt water taffy jump in for a quick note just before a medium finish with a hint of smoke unbaked pastry dough swirled with brown sugar and chopped almonds meets orange blossom water cream soda coconut flakes and pistachio pudding there s more pastry toasted coconut and almonds cinnamon brown sugar and orange on the palate along with plenty of oak a splash of water goes a long way to emphasize the prettier flavors while playing down some of the youthful heat fruity and fresh there are aromas of juicy fruit gum honeydew underripe bananas and floral notesâa garden in bloom the palate retains freshness with herbaceous flavors of parsley and cucumber as well as melon licorice white pepper and a pop of cumin oak pepper licorice and bouquet garni on the finish unconventional but enjoyable flavors driven by the still fresh oak on the nose floral notes baked apple bananas and chocolate malt the palate is light and slightly green with herbal parsley notes lime and lemon then expanding to vanilla bitter chocolate peanut shells pepper and tobacco the finish is chocolaty with more notes of peanut as well as orange peel herbaceousness and peppery heat the dried fruit almost like fruit roll-ups quickly veers toward circus peanuts candy taffy and bubble gum with notes of herbsâ especially dill the palate remains a bit of a fruit bomb with banana peach puree dried papaya and other tropical fruits then clove and allspice add some complexity a flavorful if slightly peculiar bourbon dominated by tutti-frutti flavors and dill the nose is loaded with jasmine orange blossoms fresh peaches gummy bears red wine grape fruit leather and lashings of vanilla in the mouth it s a mixed berry bonanzaâraspberry blueberry and strawberryâwith cherry red vines chocolate and a hint of tobacco leaf though light with a somewhat short finish it s well-balanced and tasty this undergoes secondary maturation in heavily toasted and smoked new charred oak barrels but you wouldn t know it from the delicate nose redolent with white flowers asian pear cardamom toasted almonds and milk chocolate the only hint is a bit of burnt sugar and dry leaves on the palate those special barrels reveal themselves with flavors of cedar black pepper chipotle and barbecue potato chips as well as apple pecan and milk chocolate the finish has chili-chocolate and long polished oak a blend of straight bourbons and american whiskeys all aged at least 4 years this is fruit cocktail in a glass cherries blackberries wild strawberries and sweet orange along with allspice clove nutmeg and a hint of cedar sweet viscous and full in the mouth with more fruit cooked cherry orange peel peach spices and plenty of oak all the way to the finish this is unique in that it seems to be malt-forward specifically floor malt with oak and cinnamon following but caramel enters the dance and does so in a big way nuances of crã¨me brã»lã©e caramel popcorn maple syrup and caramelized corn with hints of cola raspberry and apple tart while the flavor is here the finish is just a touch short to put this in elite company nonetheless it s a decent sipper cotton candy campfire smoke cinnamon pilsner beer butterscotch and vanilla start a whiskey conversation that s about balance easy sipping and the pursuit of spice around mid-palate a plethora of baking spicesâclove nutmeg vanilla cinnamon and allspiceâcharms the senses it s set up to be a great run but the approach softens toward the finish with muted brown sugar appearing still the flavor and balance make for a fun sipper and great cocktail mixer fairly light in flavor with warm cereal and honey notes laced with aromas of green herbs chamomile and spearmint seems well-crafted but the flavors are generally understated offering gentle sweetness and fleeting glimmers of baking spice modest body and a touch hot on the finish drier on the palate than the 90 with more caramel than honey and more oak spice especially vanilla and grip on the finish still rather light in personality however i m looking for more sweet notes to partner with the dried spice price is per 375 ml some bourbons are balanced or complex this is an all-around versatile pour with initial notes of lightly toasted oak brown sugar and butterscotch a fun maltiness concentrated caramel and slight hints of cinnamon and watermelon juicy fruit hammer home its sipping potential but its short to medium finish suggests that it s more suited for cocktails but hey why not both? it begins with notes of brown sugar nutter butter hazelnut nutmeg and vanilla with hints of roasted nuts they re pronounced and rounded with secondary and tertiary notes introducing malt cornbread and salt water taffy the medium finish offers a hint of bacon bits a batch of oeso 12 year old obsv 12 year old and oesk 16 year old normally four roses expresses a near-patented cinnamon note up front with fruity undertones not this time earth oak powerfully rich caramel nutmeg vanilla barrel char with slight hints of grain corn syrup and cardamom finally the quintessential cinnamon shows over a slightly disappointing medium finish distilled in 2001 this year s release is a departure from recent releases which were complex and nicely balanced it s more aggressive with tannins and oak dominating and lacking the body and sweetness to balance it it s my least favorite of this year s offerings dark chocolate toffee tobacco and dried fruit round out the palate and offer some comfort buffalo trace antique collection 2016 smells like bourbonâcorn a bit of cinnamon oakâbut there s something else a touch of doughy sweetness a note of straight wood a twist light and pleasant with enough heat to keep it respectable and likely alive in a cocktail all the usual suspects are here but without the heavier oak character afternoon bourbon the nose on this is lovely and seductive with a gingerbread cookie quality coupled with leather and baking spices the palate is lively and warming with root beer spices but its character is overshadowed by the intensity of the toasted barrel and feels just a bit hollow beneath all that lavish oak from the folks at willett distillery noah s mill has less than 20 barrels in a batch and will include 15 year old barrels in the dump the deep amber color prepares the nose for what promises to be an exciting ride aromas of ginger plums cinnamon fresh-baked cornbread and fresh-squeezed cherries the warm palate packs caramel nutmeg and vanilla with lovely cinnamon on the finish sourced whiskey the port finish is very evident but not overpowering a fruit basket on the palate with caramel apple currants red and black bramble apricot toasted coconut vanilla wafer and anise rich and velvety in texture with a long gently sweet finish cornbread and toffee start this alluring whiskey followed by hints of paprika fruits flowers and caramel afterward it opens up into a bakery with cinnamon rolls caramel chews vanilla cupcakes and ginger baking spices and earth appear over a medium finish that offers black licorice it s well-suited for mixing the new elder sibling to the standard bulleit it shows the bulleit personality but it s deeper and drier on the nose and palate as would be expected with more oak dried orchard fruit and dark berried fruit along with a hint of barrel char leather vanilla powder and a dusting of cinnamon i d save this as a postprandial bourbon and opt for the standard bulleit as an aperitif sweet reek of the warehouse sugary bourbon drooling and drying on oak staves the richly boozy air dusty wood it s all here like bardstown in a bottle enters with authority a hot rush of corn solidly oak-edged sizzling with allspice and cinnamon and backed with a solid strop of leather then the sun comes up a sweet glowing finish beautifully bridges the gap between young and old bourbon and an absolute steal at the price vibrantly fruity with strawberry and orange creamsicle on the nose along with clean hay toasted oak cinnamon caramel and bay leaf wood spices on the front palate give way to orange custard pomegranate caramel and cinnamon bread notes with a pop of chili-dusted roasted corn lashed with bitter oak on the finish hot wet oak berries red hots and wet cornmeal closer to the nose it s sharper and woodier lots of wood on the entry but sweet corn and cloved hard candy too with heat from the 100 proof that lingers through the oaky finish at 7 years this is extra-spicy and a touch of water tames the heat and the oak bowman s still finding its way but the path seems right sourced from several undisclosed kentucky bourbon distillers well-rounded and nicely balanced with prominent spice cinnamon clove evergreen powdered vanilla soft fruit mandarin coconut apricot hint of pineapple and toasted nuts all on a bed of caramel very versatile mature enough for pleasurable sipping but just and youthful enough to add zing to a cocktail this new jack daniel s offering is marketed as being bold and smooth it certainly is bolder when compared to the standard jack daniel s offering with a mã©lange of corn creamy vanilla toasted caramel bright citrus and dry resinous oak spiked with cinnamon the smoothness ends however when the oak grip intensifies on the finish adding ice does tame the oak if that s your thing still i d prefer the oak be more restrained price is per liter think corn roasted canned creamed mashed pan-fried in salsa and in bread the corn pops early and often this complements hazelnut caramel pudding and baking spices a drop of water really opens this up softening the corn-heavy notes and bringing forth fruits and spices even the finish is better with water perhaps this whiskey was meant to have a lower proof this blend of 6 to 8 year old bourbon is finished for 3 to 4 months in casks that aged cognac for 12 years there s fruit especially dried apricot pear passion fruit grapefruit and cherry then caramel oak leather tobacco vanilla and a slight hint of cinnamon honestly there s a textural brandy-and-bourbon struggle but beautiful vanilla and nutmeg

cinnamon orange creamsicle on the palate with a good deal of apple poached pear marmalade and light smoke salted butter gentle oak and wispy smoke keep this in balance a good harmony of flavors it s hard to stand out in a sea of fairly bland moonshine but manhattan moonshine manages to by moving beyond corn in their mashbill with oat rye spelt and malt the result is an unaged whiskey that s light slightly sweet and a symphony of cereal grains the addition of the honey note from the oats is spot on and helps unite the grain flavors a dash of spice creates balance and drives a dry finish this is a wonderfully crafted and unique whiskey one of the first non-kentucky bonded bourbons since the 1950s there s trepidation in this glass floral pear peach and chocolate tickle the nose leading to

below the extra age shows this is canadian-mellow not a fiery american rye even at 45% all the spice is there and the floralgrassy complexity but there are more rich oak notes and a high arching finish that sustains the whiskey on the palate three batches of malt smoked separately with peat cherry wood and beech the nose is islay-reminiscent peat with some beech bacon under it but the top is

cinnamon buns chocolate pistachio baked apple cloves and cracked pepper the finish is punctuated by sweet vanilla syrup and bitter orange pipe tobacco and light pepper smooth and pleasant it perhaps could use more aging but is well executed nonetheless it would be easy to hate on this as bourbon but taken merely as a whiskey it s compelling original and surprisingly well-knit the nose betrays the smoke and sea of its islay cask finish while the palate offers more sweet vanilla candied nuts and citrus before circling back with distinct vegetal notes of seaweed and jalapeã±o perhaps bourbon is

hard candies rye spice and salt brine medium-bodied fresh and delicious distillery only 375ml made from malted bavarian hard wheat and aged over 2 years in new and used american oak barrels the nose is chocolate-covered pretzels and a dash of pepper spice with a slight edge the entry is much softer than expected at this proof driven by toasted wheat and dark chocolate with vanilla and black pepper a strong pepper kick at the end of the mid-palate drives a long spicy finish a surprisingly well-balanced and actualized young craft whiskey certified organic aged under four years oak is forward on the noseâyoung and fresh-sawnâwith sweet spicy hard candies cinnamon and teaberry juicy in the mouth sweet springing with that spice-fruit bounce off an oak board rye oil hides in the

cocoa and maduro tobacco notes but the chest-thumping herbal oak brings it to a quick and slightly bitter finish a splash of water brings the elements into better balance as peach syrup sweetness starts to shine an unabashedly spicy rye nose backed by cinnamon marzipan bartlett pear and oak the rye spice is right there on the palate and immediately joined by cinnamon clove black pepper solid oak and a lingering pear note on the fringe the finish is long dry and spicy with a hint of black licorice candy pritchard s rye is a perfect example of how you can have strong spice without a lot of fire and create balance without adding a lot of sweetness oak-driven and tightly wound with herbal licorice beeswax and dried peaches there is a real outdoorsy quality here of forest floor autumn

of corn and woodsy vanilla sweet flavors bubble on the tongue coconut circus peanuts peanut butter fudge vanilla jellybeans the finish lingers in corn and rye there s more than meets the eye here and it s priced for impulsive experimentation this is a bold style of bourbon finished in american brandy barrels and brandishing fiery spirit and sweet corn yet the beautiful sweetness layered with

like fireworks a rush to an explosion of sweet oaky heat in the back of the mouth with a slow spark rain that sparkles on the tongue exciting while it s not technically a grain buckwheat makes great pancakes so buckwheat whiskey? otay this has an earthy aroma of hickory nuts and autumn leaves with some cinnamon peeking through reminds me of corsair s quinoa whiskey there s a cushioned creamy mouthfeel more raw nuts a keen of oak a sweet lift through the mouth and at the end the leaves and more oak unique intriguing compelling i keep going back for one more taste price is per 375 ml single barrel releases aren t uncommon at craft bars but a whiskey distilled by the bar s proprietor is rare dark amber color suggests high barrel impact but the wood is actually well balanced by caramel milk chocolate and honey-nut cereal the opening is much softer lusher than you d expect at this proof and balances in the mid-palate with oak salt cinnamon and a little heat a dry finish rounds out a unique and flavorful whiskey less than 50 bottles grandten distilling s south boston store only razor-sharp aromas of clove seasoned wood and dried grass push firmly out of the glass hard-edged grain and spice continue on the palate but without the harshness you might expect from young whiskey with such a bold nose it softens toward the finish and becomes sweeter with a hint of buttery fudge then develops an oaky dryness at the end impressive young whiskey mild and mellow nose of corn and oak with a bit of warehouse reek and a light cleanly earthy note smooth and sweet in the mouth with sweet

maple brown sugar cinnamon and rye spice at 113 proof it s still soft supple and lush but slightly tannic the finish is spicy but not overly hot or dry great distilling hampered by small barrels but still something special aromas of woodsmoke with hints of hot tar and rubber are draped over ripe berry fruit dark and somewhat brash it comes off a touch hot fully revealing its 100 proof becoming more fruit driven on the palate as sweet berry buckwheat honey and sorghum syrup give way to smoldering baking spice on the drying oak-laced finish more muscle than finesse however the 21% quercus garryana is revealing itself more in this second iteration briney sea air wet stones and pretty wisps of campfire smoke give this a strong scottish bent while the medium-bodied palate nicely balances the sweet malt salt and smoke in a bit of salt water taffy showing nice complexity and balance overall the finish smolders and evolves to become more herbaceous a blend 89% 2 year 6 month old mgp bourbon 11% 3 year old mckenzie rye other batches are different whiskeys sweet nose some cinnamon and allspice dried hay and clear toy candies hot on the tongue with the spicy peppery intensity of youth and rye and roars right on through to the end where oak appears to add gravity to the finish this would rock in a cocktail spicy buttery nose aged six months with oak staves with some oak plank notes hey thats pretty tasty rye character is spicy forward and flows surely right into the nicely warm finish michigan-grown rye done in a pot still in downtown detroit about a mile and a half from the hiram walker plant good young rye one to watch scottish highland malt whisky from an undisclosed source no age given finished in virginia in virginia port barrels rich port fumes hit the nose malt

whiskey interesting idea sourced whiskey crafted from estate-farmed organic grain and aged for 2 years the flavors are impressively seamless with nice complexity and everything neatly in its place fresh oak is well integrated with notes of orange rind rosewater sweet corn and red fruits the slick buttery palate sizzles with peppery spiceâcinnamon hearts candies and ginger robust in flavor while showing impressive craftsmanship and polish 375ml lavish red fruit and sherry blanket this whiskey initially aged in american oak barrels followed by 12-18 months in oloroso sherry casks to approach 5 years age in total it may be the light toast of the initial barrels that allows this wheat whiskey to stand up exceptionally well developing seamless flavors of figgy pudding walnuts chocolate-covered raisins cacao nibs and maple candy culminating in a finish that nicely balances fruit and leathery oak carries its proof nicely craft skeptics will find this very aligned to mainstream bourbon with its enticing nose of peanut chews candy gooey caramel and cocoa powder the palate pours on sweet cornbread and marzipan just a touch hot and slightly antiseptic before the long finish of cherry and sweet vanilla lots of good stuff going on here this amber-hued whiskey seems part bourbon part single malt offering a nose of sweet dried fruits âraisin and applesâheaped with earthy leathery oak the palate is enjoyable for its crã¨me caramel sweetness and drinkability but the drying oak is a bit heavy-handed overwhelming the medium body a serviceable and versatile whiskey for the price corn malted barley wheat and rye the appealing nose features pretty biscuit notes great purity of malt and golden honeyed sweetness before adding some flavors of citrus blossom clover and cardamom with hints of licorice on the palate the initial sweet malt quickly turns herbal with marjoram and a distinct sage note that lingers through a long finish of salt-tinged sweetness aged 2 years 6 months in full-size charred oak this whiskey portrays its coastal origin with a lovely sea-air quality that vies for attention with brown sugar beeswax and delicate smoke notes gentle peatiness weaves through the cocoa-tinged honeyed malt on the palate culminating in a smoldering finish where the mouthwatering saltiness seals the deal nicely integrated and well balanced with fine pot still character a single malt of pale and peated malts aged 7 years in bourbon barrels same mashbill as the laws four grain aged 4 years hard dry corn aromas no sulfur hot straightforward corn and oak with active spices one of the leanest most austere young bourbons i ve ever tasted no compromises no lush sweetness savory bourbon the finish is great tingling and tasty for a long time after the swallow not a bonded for cocktails sip this mashbill of 95% rye 5% malt both colorado-sourced aged 3 years in full-size barrels same grass and spice in the nose as the straight rye but a sweet almost sherry-like note as well flavors are similarârye grain bitter oil alcohol heatâbut there s an added hit of dry cocoa more heat and a better non-sticky finish with a grudging hint of sweetness at the end dialed up overall initially restrained as the nose opens up it reveals plum red berry fruit pine resin and root-beer spices the palate picks up a bit slightly vinous in its red-fruit drive herbal-cherry cough drop and sweet vanilla leading to a modest finish laced with licorice cinnamon and pine forest it s all about the grain on the nose corncob cooked mash along with hay and grass brown sugar and earthy dried herbs chewy tannins overtake more subtle fruit and spice notes in the mouth add a little water to reveal grape jelly milk chocolate and cinnamon candy an impressive start from this young kentucky distillery though the short finish shows it has some developing yet to do 236 bottles there s no missing the peat here the nose is rife with ash rubber tires wood-burning fireplace and cedar bark but it also reveals lovely aromas of roasted apples charred corn black pepper and roasted walnuts sweet corn apples honey and nuts step forward on the palate which is a bit hot along with black pepper cinnamon dark chocolate and oak the finish is enjoyable ashinessâthe end of a cigar seattle bourbon made using northwest grains aromas of goldenrod golden raisins and spicy stewed prunes a panoply of alluring spices chocolate and oak the palate carries through with similar notes along with apricot and dark red fruits but a dusty edge and an excess of tight tannic green oak hold it back chili-chocolate spice minerality and lingering fruit on the finish impressive complexity but somewhat woody and off-balance traditionally this release has been a showcase for the raw power and spice of both young and old rye in this single barrel release the spice and fire have been considerably tamed by deep caramel vanilla and sweet corn the spice is still there with oak rye and cinnamon but is no longer the star the proof shows up in the finish which is long and quite dry an understated expression of one of high west s flagship releases sourced whiskey drink up new york only a blend of 3 year old single malt 30% 3 year old whiskey distilled from pilsner beer 20% and 7 year old whiskey distilled from stout 30% unsurprisingly the nose is hoppy with an overlay of pine bough and a tropical fragrance of lemon and pineapple the palate is deeper with more hops and pine plus bitter citrus lime and white pepper the finish melds bitter chocolate roasted pecans and toasty oak 3960 bottles bright and lively with violets plenty of fresh oak and traces of mint and pine leading to a palate of butterscotch bright citrus warming spice and sweet vanilla with drying and dusty cocoa there is a glimmer of youth expected given that 20% of this blend is their own distillery-made rye aged less than 2 years it s an exciting glimpse of what s to come but the younger rye does little to enhance the great stuff they ve been sourcing whistle pig raised the share of its own 2 year old rye from 20 percent to 32 percent in this second farmstock release balancing it against 6 and 10 year old sourced ryes like in the 001 release fresh oak mixes with vanilla orange peel and pepper on the nose leading to a palate of vanilla and butterscotch citrus emerges with water pepper notes return on the finish along with chocolate and caramel there s youthfulness here but also potential wheats have a fruitier nose than bourbons it seems and this is no exception gentle almost delicate fruits on the nose white grapes honeydew melon baked apple so smooth on the palate sweet pastry light baked apple a nice oak grip keeping it all together sip it straight or build a big highball with just a splash of soda on the ice such a friendly whiskey warm delicate vapors curl from the glass dry grain sweet orange peel honey candy but all of it ethereally light quick in the mouth makes other whiskeys seem heavy with wood sweet grain is the base of the structure with a skin of soft citrus candy and custard notes wood is mostly present as a lightweight frame almost like a

on the palate spice fudge vanilla grain and oak this is brash loud stuff broad-shouldered insistent and cocky could find favor with the hophead clan of craft beer drinkers you d think it could use

still amber with a distinct redpink cast to it very fruity noseâgreengage plum mulberry sweet orangeâwith creamy vanilla tastes of sweet cereal with a firm bitter keel the fruit returns as an echo in the finish a very craft beer-like whiskey challenging interesting unexpected a bit brash but worth investigating wigle s also doing a series of finishing experiments with the addition of honeycombed wood chunks to their organic wheat whiskey this one uses white ash sweeter nose than the straight-up wheat whiskey see below mouth is cleaner and the astringency i noted on the end is ameliorated all a matter of degrees though quite similar to the regular wheat whiskey price is per 375 ml the first bourbon made in pennsylvania in over 25 years using locally-grown organic wapsie

nose the peat presents itself as an autumn bonfire with dried logs and dried leaves mingling with gentle spices of white pepper dried ginger and a bit of salinity the wood keeps burning through the palate which is fairly hot and replete with classic bourbon flavors of vanilla caramel roasted nuts and apples pleasant enough but ultimately a simple whiskey floral and spice including orange blossom

older bourbon craft still presents some hard choices is it whiskey? sorghum s a grain but sorghum syrup is pressed from the stalk of the plant but highwire distilling uses muddy pond sorghum syrup which mashes the grain in with the stalk soâ¦we ll say yes whiskey spritely on the tongue lively and quick sweet but spicy with oak and not an off note crying for a cube and a shot of seltzer

bit of water to subdue the punch this becomes impressively smooth and fruity revealing sandalwood aromas and offering a lovely long finish of candied orange and sweet chocolate-covered cherries 60% corn 20% wheat 10% rye 10% barley an enjoyable 2 year old from colorado the sweet stone fruit nose laced with mint and herb garden betrays this spirit as a bit young and primary still a touch hot and lacking some intensity but pleasing clover honey sweetness on the palate and long warming spice with a cocoa finish bode very well for the future driven by earthy oak and dark cocoa on the nose this whiskey is alluring in its rustic richness with saddle leather and a pocketful of dried fruit pulled from an old backpack on the palate the cherry and red berry fruit meet some pleasant peppery and clove spice with the impression of lemon oil pleasingly drinkable with caramel and more oak on the modest finish this whiskey shows some green-spirit youth but it s headed in a good direction with sassafras toasted nuts leather forest aromas and a touch of furniture polish it s much bigger on the palate as burnt peanut candies meet baking spices and treacle the wood jumps out a bit and the fiery youth is undeniable but plenty to like 2580 bottles the nose offers a nice mã©lange of herbal and fruit notes as pine sap earthy forest floor and menthol balance with sweet bananas foster and baked apple more banana on the palate plus juicy stone fruits sprinkled with cinnamon before a drying finish that nicely weaves cocoa spices oak and saddle leather makes a pleasant first impression as sweet apple and corn notes meet summer flowers cracker jack and fresh oak the palate shows a pleasingly oily texture as butterscotch candy and roasted peanuts come with hints of spice and orange peel the nutty finish shows toasted almonds and caramel aromas of menthol licorice and herbs have a slightly antiseptic quality yet the caramelized oak and grilled pineapple flavors keep it grounded in bourbon bold and intriguing on the palate it pours a bit hot with lots of cedar shingle and sandalwood balanced by banana and toasted marshmallow cinnamon and candied orange on the finish a blend of indiana bourbons and tennessee whiskeys finished in red wine casks though it takes some easing into this whiskey shows pretty clove and vanilla notes on the nose along with some elmer s glue and grape kool-aid the palate is where the rye grain starts to shine with spice peaches plums and milk and white chocolate and cooked cherries on the finish water is a must to cut through the youthful heat this is one for the oak fanatics wood and grain assert themselves right from the start but the nose retains balance with aromas of butterscotch fresh ginger and herbs the oak-forward palate shows pleasant flavors of cherry cough drop dark chocolate blackberries red licorice star anise and ginger oak continues on the finish which has nice length don t be shy about adding water mellow as moonlight on the label the old cascade slogan from the pre-dickel branding days at dickel this is a throwback too from before the barrel the nose is full of sweet and fresh corn cream and cornbread a nod to dickel s 84% corn mashbill some peppery notes join it on the palate but that corn sweetness follows all the way to the end one of the best white whiskeys i ve tasted and not overpriced off-market for two years nose of caramel sugar wafers and a touch of just-ripe nectarine sweetsmooth in the mouth with sweet mint rock candy and gliding king syrup flavors slipping all over the tongue while oak notes provide high spiciness finishes with a lingering light sweetness like a dissolving sugar flake with all the sweetness though it doesn t cloy nice if not complex a rarity among the large american distillers whiskey with a mashbill of 65% malted barley and 35% corn no rye or wheat the malted barley and corn dominate the flavor profile along with soft sweet notes of orchard fruit and golden raisin kissed with honey the finish is soft sweet and quick clean with an easy-going demeanor not particularly complex however if only the 35% corn was halved to include an equal amount of rye a blend of bourbon rye and smoky scotch whisky the foundation here is bourbon sweetness caramel toffee vanilla with a tug-of-war between rye spice cinnamon evergreen nutmeg and peat smoke tobacco and honey-soaked berries round out the palate with additional leather notes on the finish not something i would drink every day but this whisky packs plenty of intrigue sourced whiskey high west now has aged whiskey of their own make this oat whiskey was aged less than two years in used cooperage and that s just what it looks like about chardonnay color in the glass the aroma is mellow and sweet with a hint of flowers and grapes clean and surprisingly mellow sweet grain flavors even a bit creamy but the 46% delivers a high bite very nice finish limited annual release in december it shows nice maturity considering it contains whiskey as young as two years old smooth too with layered sweetness honeyed caramel english toffee maple syrup tangerine roasted nuts and peppered with spice warming cinnamon glazed ginger good grip of tobacco and polished leather on the finish balances the sweetness that comes earlier an example of the right way to do artisan distilling a nose of white pepper and spice as well as salty brine light sea smoke and toasted wood followed by white chocolate confectionery sweetness and wild berries rich and full on a front palate that s somewhat youthful led by notes of vanilla milk chocolate marzipan and treacle with lemon and almond adding some zest the finish lingers with a hint of salinity and toasted wood as well as light smoke triticale is a wheatrye hybrid which i guess appealed to the wheat-mad dry fly distillers aromas of grass bubble gum and oak taste is young brashly sweet but smooth enough to spread easily over the tongue there s spiceâlight

well-done overall oat malt rye and wheat are the four organic grains like you i was instantly curious nice amber color hot and sweet with a hint of dill on the nose rafting in on a thick oak plank sweet grain cut wood and lingering heat make this good but im looking for more complexity theres no clear handle to this one no im bourbon or im malt which is intriguing but its justgood not inspiring

fourthâ¦whatever aromas of corn vanilla and teaberry with a pleasant broadness and light herbal notes there s a nutty note to the sweet corn and vanilla and a move in the direction of astringency but it s intriguing a definite plus the layered finish has a woody nip to it that dry earthiness and sweet corn distilled from imperial stout and vapor infused with hops this is a bold example of darek bell s alt whiskeys piney hops hot toffee and chocolate notes fill the nose it s a long ride on the palate brisk spice first then hops and hot malt a mealy undercurrent that pulls you from a cocoa start to a hot and sweet finish with a burnt note on the very end busy but consistent there is a rich and robust distillate lurking under all that oak with chewy maple candies chocolate-covered cherries and rhum agricole intensity the astringent oak does no favors for the heat of this 100-proof whiskey but with its lingering dark chocolate and char it s still a bold and tasty rye a young minimum of 6 months rye finished in california vermouth barrels the results are polarizing i m in the intriguingly tasty camp the nose rye spice with herbal depth and fruit wreathing the whiskey hits first but herbal vermouth is right behind putting more body on the spirit and cranking the finish in an unexpectedly dry almost bitter direction an aperitif whiskey begging to play with cocktails or even ice but good neat craft whiskey continues to experiment rich full and clean cornbread nose with just a hint of herbal zip not what i expected at all from a white whiskey with a jokey name and label light vaporous corn glides over the tongue with a hint of fresh grass easing off the palate to an airy corn finish a lingering thought of corn corn eau de vie with an accomplished touch on the still very impressive bourbon made with arkansas corn soft red winter wheat and malted barley white flowers citrus fresh dill and wet cardboard on the nose the palate is woody and somewhat harsh with some chocolate raspberry and ground pepper flavors quite dry with tannic oak and sticky pine bitter oak on the finish primarily wood-driven the oak overpowers the other flavors limited by its obvious youth on the nose but the fresh herb chiffonade character offers intrigue with distinct sage coupled with some chamomile notes the palate is a step in the right direction with dark berries spices vanilla and charred marshmallows although somewhat light bodied and supple in texture young but sweet and honest local montana grains in an impressively brown all-montana bourbon has a small-barrel smell to itâa dry wood and hard candy note i m starting to recognizeâand a snap of rye interesting light but not weakâ in the mouth i found their moonshine not that clean but the wood s done a good job on it rye grass and sweet corn mingle with pepper and anise clean finish montana only one of a series of berkshire bottlings done in barrels used to age craft beers this one aged the massive 29% and complex samuel adams utopias the beer barrel adds a depth to berkshire s usually brighter character a rounded and full sweetness with rum and fruit notes there s heat and youthful sweetness and a pleasing fullness that grows toward the warming finish a nice twist on the usual bottling massachusetts only another from a series of beer barrel-finished bourbons from this massachusetts distiller this one s from a terrapin brewing s monk s revenge belgian ipa barrel nose is fruity and sweet with an undertone of linen and old iron there is the bitter and faintly piney edge of hops in the whiskey which adds a cutting grip to the finish before that there is spoonbread oak and a hint of anise interesting components needs a bit more integration another mgpldi-sourced rye which kgb spirits then ages additionally at their alcalde new mexico site it s tagged as a 15 year old whiskey an oaky sweet nose with hot cereal notes the tongue impact is breathtaking a hot thick slam of spice mint and wood that cools to a long sweet mint finish a bit of water tames it a bit and brings out more oaky notes and more sweetness powerful stuff a 2 year old bourbon made from texas-grown white corn it sports a dusty nose full of dry corn and oaky spice the whiskey is big-boned juicy and sweet but with a bitter streak of wood running through it the finish confirms the youth of the whiskey as it flames in a long hot wind-up some very interesting components here waiting for better integration crystal clear and colorless somewhat rich for unaged corn spirit corn baked apple grass and a very light honeysuckle syrup quite mellow on the tongue sweet but with a drying finish of baked grain sweet dried grass and finally just a hint of heat high in the mouth a pleasant little glass distilled from a 10% 70 ibu barleywine from blue point brewing on long island i m smelling light pine hop notes dried spruce plank and heavy fudge a muddled heavy nose much better in the mouth the fudge is restrained the spruce and hops bring a lightness and verve to things not the single malt you might be expecting but very much american craft distilling like nothing else intriguing bold a bit young and with a lot of promise price is per 375 ml sourced whiskey moved to used bourbon barrels then finished in barrels that held their pine barrens whiskey also reviewed this issue pine sap sweet juicy berries and oak aromas had to re-nose to be sure on that pine mouth is relatively smooth much more so than the rough rider bourbon picking up some of that pine barren fudge and a touch of rye grassiness finish is warm and spicy a nice young rye aged less than 4 years sharp new oak this is 30-gallon barrel aged with hot cinnamon and sugar in the nose dry and a bit hot up front but its wheat comes through in a smoother sweeter middle and a gentle warm finish where corn finally appears no real flaws here it could be better integrated but it has a rough appeal rye grain fresh-sawn wood and a hint of brittle sugar no corn here the mashbill is rye wheat and malt bitter rye edge drives this into the palate blowing open space for the smoother body to follow and briefly sweeten things up before the rye warp collapses in an oily spicy savory finish quite discreet and small-scale this doesnt roar it urges good but it needs more breadth and wood depth to be great massachusetts only another american single malt from colorado a meaty savory aroma with molasses cookie and herbal cough drop underneath roughly sweet in the mouth with hints of smoke and bitter chocolate sweet orange and stewed apples with a strong back note of anise for all the strange name and really strange logo antlers on a barrel? this is not bad at all all four of these catskill whiskeys are in exceptionally beautiful bottles pleasant homey smell of furniture polish dried mint and grass golden syrup and sweet dough wrapped in a thin layer of oak brightly sweet more mint and grass some cashew richness and an insistent singing thread of oak that broadens to the finish where the sweet and the oak balance with a new note of melon a bit of astringency at the end but this is right decent whiskey price is per 375 ml you wouldn t believe from the nose on this white whiskey that it s nearly 50% alcohol sweet fresh-milled cornmeal combines with slightly acidic and floral pear with just a dash of yeast to form an inviting and approachable nose on the palate it s equally affable and well-balanced with sweet corn crisp pear and white pepper spice a nice long finish with a touch of cooling rounds off an expertly-crafted and enjoyable moonshine nose of sweet dried grass and cinnamon echoed on the palate with supports of sweet oaky vanilla the finish develops some doughiness then finally an oaky spice heat that lingers pleasantly the most interesting part of the dram well-made at cedar ridge in iowa and clean if not exceptionally complex a good flask whiskey for a hike sourced whiskey theres big oak caramel cinnamon and clove spice and fresh grain in the nose not a shy soft wheat whiskey at all good body supporting spiciness mint and young oak the small barrel punches tempered by sweet grain and spice finish gets a bit dusty and astringent crimping things wood-balanced not dominated by it bold dynamic wigle s proud to have a full 2 years of age on this organic wheat whiskey it s small-barrel dark but the nose isn t a ripper it s 100 proof hot but sweet with grain and even light fruity notes pear and ripe melon there s no denying it s aggressive especially for a wheat whiskey but the small-barrel oak blends well with the grain giving a robust set of flavors oak hard candies grilled fruit a bit loud a bit pushy but endearing nose is mild pleasant sweet with rock candy cinnamon and baked apple follow-through on the palate is almost exact mild pleasant sweet with rock candy etc plus a nice bit of extra alcohol heat and quiet oak shaping the finish a mild-mannered bourbon which i feel is like a mild-mannered rodeo bull out of place theres nothing wrong but its a bit too easy-drinking too mild bulk up now that s something you don t see every day kings county brooklyn ny used peat-smoked malt in this bourbon the nose is bonfire and sweet juicy corn the undiscovered hebridean isle of kentucky? the smoke is less forward on the tongue you don t get so much a peaty bourbon as you get an unusually rich broad young bourbon more warming corn digestive biscuits and a pleasantly hot finish compelling andâ¦what kind of manhattan would this make? 400 bottles at the distillery onlyâ price is per 375 ml sweet vanilla dried berries and a soft display of woodsmoke introduce this whiskey while notably improved from earlier bottlings the sherry is still rendered a bit dull like chocolate-covered cherries as smoky cocoa nibs and the chewy malt meet on the palate offering a honeyed finish with hints of baking chocolate cereal grains flour-dusted breadboard fresh cut hay horehound lozenge and apple pie the appearance of fig newtons cookie and toasted rye bread flavors nicely complements green peppercorn spice and an herb garden edge with good length to the salted-caramel and sweet maple finish pot distilled from 100% michigan rye and aged in full-sized barrels it s just a touch green but drinking nicely and totally on track more patience will pay dividends two things show almost immediately alcohol level and sherry cask heat and salty nuttiness really express themselves early on eventually followed by flavors of caramel chew graham cracker nutmeg and cinnamon with an unwanted bitterness walnut shell and smoked meat come along too for a medium finish that tingles with a drop of water its bitterness turns to oak making it the preferred way to sip its hefty proof sourced whiskey there is lovely freshness here with sawn oak bread dough and baking spice aromas despite the generous 80% rye content the malt component really comes through offering good backbone creamy caramel sweetness and approachability a streak of pleasingly peppery rye is balanced with sweet vanilla leading to a lively finish with mint and chocolate malt balls a 1 year old whiskey made from rye wheat and cherrywood-smoked malt an interesting sweetsour nose with montmorency cherry sweet grain bitter rye and a slap of fresh leather jacket follows through in the mouth but more integrated a sweet cocktail of neat whiskey with only the slightest hint of smoke the leather slips in at the finish and wraps things up neatly a bit overly sweet a bit simple but good 100% rye unmalted and malted direct-fire pot stilled old wood finished a detailed label but no age statement or straight peppery minty nose with a fleeting hint of coal smoke lots of heat fierce rye flavor hot and sweet and then a fantastic finish that curls and flexes sweet oily hot pepper and small barrel oak the rest of it s okay but that finish is a marvelous ride made from 100% organic red winter wheat aged 2 years 1 month much lighter on the nose than its rye stablemate see above notes of butterscotch and green tea with a bit of oaky strength flavors of cracked grain and light stone fruits shimmer across the tongue the oak stays high in the mouth finishâ is light and long moving from grain to wood at the end interesting and delicate for a 2 year old 100% pilsner malt fermented with belgian ale yeast not unaged whiskey a grain spirit meant to be drunk without aging sweet-tart intense aroma of unripe cherries plums white pepper and a bit of caramel smooth on the tongue with a roll of heat grain comes forward and dominates the fruit though it balances at the finish clean even interesting more poitin should be like this pennsylvania and new jersey only 100% malt whiskey aged to taste in white oak vats 1000-2000 gallons on toasted cubes of hickory maple mulberry red oak and grape wood pleasantly fruity nose with a firm oak backboard malt is dominant on the tongue a bit shallow but the woods contribute a bubbling complexity unfortunately things don t really come together in the finish but the experiment s not a loss given the interesting effects of the multiple woods worth a taste light and delicate characteristics abound the nose has raspberries and orange peel along with fresh-cut wood iced tea and rose petals wood dominates the palate lifted by gentle spice rock candy walnut shell stewed plums and grain the finish is short with cola wood and bread soft and sweet ripe apricot honeyed porridge and sweet vanilla take the lead with a palate that elicits warm peach cobbler sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon there is lots of freshly-sawn oak apparent throughout but ample fruit keeps this whiskey juicy right through a pleasantly spicy finish fruit forward smooth and lovely a real eye-opener for a whiskey of 100% soft white winter wheat 375ml a mashbill of 60201010 cornwheatryemalt aged 3 years in full-size barrels nose is sweet hot corn but with an initial puff of sulfur where s that from? interesting splash in the mouth with smooth wheat character knocking back the rye spice fairly hot with some clovecinnamon spice amping up as it winds down to the warm finish very active whiskey a nice jolt of violets pepper and sawn oak on the nose is underscored by some green stick and leafy sassafras notes turning a bit more dark and chewy on the palate with caramel figgy fruit green peppercorns and a long and bold finish dominated by dark chocolate softens up nicely with water and reveals more fruitiness herbal licorice and cinnamon notes are initially quite alluring but stifled by a slightly sour note peering through still this is identifiably bourbon with sweet corn drive leathery oak and cocoa coming together nicely before a warming finish of spice candies seems to show good maturity on the nose with nutty herbal woody and husky grain aromas the notes of warm porridge with brown sugar portend the sweet palate almost cloying with ripe red fruits warm chocolaty and spicy but the somewhat hot finish and dusty oak floorboard quality don t leave the best lasting impression oak-forward with gentle sweetness and light in body this is a simple and enjoyable enough with straightforward vanilla and toasted nuts the finish is a touch astringent as the drying oak tannins slightly overwhelm the modest fruit heat and peat dominate the noseâthis is young and fiery with rubber bonfire cedar chest charred corn and apple aromas the palate continues to burn though with a nice amount of grilled meat red fruit and flavored tobacco notes especially when water is added unfortunately the smoke is not so well-integrated and it shows on the finish which has a cloying sweet ashiness a blend of straight bourbon and rye whiskeys a younger-tasting expression when compared to high west s original bourye pleasant enough to drink neat or with a splash of water but that certainly wouldn t be my first choice sweet foundation caramel vanilla custard candy corn along with honeyed fruit macadamia cinnamon nutmeg and soft mint comes across as a bit confused at times and the flavors aren t always well defined it seemed a good idea to revisit omg after high west had four years  experience under their belt the wet grain and green apple are still there with the bitter fringe of rye crisping things nicely pure rye high west spirit no oak and you see where this may go a smooth almost creamy entryâsmooth for the proofâand the rye takes over though grainy sweetness refuses to quit more polished now hope there s plenty in wood wheat has been swapped for oats in this release but the agenda remains the same a very primary whiskey with grain at the forefront and just a hint of oak roundness to the surprisingly creamy palate fresh flour violet candies hints of clove spice and persistent sweetness the palate gives the impression of warm breakfast cereal laced with banana and lemon a testament to the quality of the distillate certified organic distilled from 100% rye first whiff like that smell when you tear apart anti-theft plastic packaging swirl and warm to get unseeded rye bread old books bitter grass palate is quite right sweet grain and a bit of mint balanced by bitter rye oils and wood slipping into a sweet but wood-framed finish pleasantly youthful whiskey in the mouth nose is sharp still hard to say what this is the label just says whiskey my nose though says irish whiskey grassy malt sweet heat light pear esters its there in the mouth too smooth sweet malt vaporous lift off the tongue irish light elegance and a lingering finish with a slippery hint of vanilla considering the eponymous distiller is irish nice stuff now tell us more about it barrel 2 was aged in 15-gallon bourbon refills then finished in a cedar ridge rum barrel interesting to see an american distiller walk away from straight whiskey with used small cooperage aromas of sawdust toffee melon and just-ripe apricot dry cocoa and warm cereal fight a bit with alcohol heat rum and fruit float over malt and vanilla in the mouth and the wood rounds and dries oak and faint allspice in the finish needs some more taming great start smells sweet and minty with gobs of oak and cornâ¦and that s about how it tastes too the corn sweetness and the mint are dominant but warming oak spice wraps it loosely it s called young bourbon labeled as age under 4 years and that s just what it tastes like as some green youthful notes muscle their way in toward the finish a bit of a rough-rider but tasty a 21 blend of rye and hand-malted barley lightly smoked with fruitwood aged with apple and oak wood chips in used bourbon barrels finished in another used bourbon barrel aged 12 months total was it worth it? a good rye smell with fruit notes quite appealing relatively smooth and the smoke comes through quickly with sweet pepper spice and vanilla not overly complex but well-made and pleasant organic rye all grown on the myer farm in the finger lakes by john myer himself 100% rye converted with enzymes the myers do everything in-house nose is bent with rye oiliness and a faint peppermint brightness in the mouth it s rye bitterness all the way through a crisp fresh-chewed mint in a mouthful of sweet grassiness and then a very quick finish wham bam and gone simple and clean could add depth and polish a 100% rye whiskey made from rye grown about 30 miles from mississippi river distilling strongly spicy and oily rye character reaching out of the glass and grabbing my nose some surprising pastry and molasses notes hiding in there the 40% mildness is disappointing at first but develops into a spicy minty mouth-filler with a cleanly sweet finish on the sweet side would prefer it drier sweet corn and oak with some green apple and grass notes a light pleasant nose that goes hot closer to the surface quite light and young in the mouth clean with understated oak notes not taxing or tiring and a long finish of teaberry and mint nothing amazing or overly complex but a clean pleasant sip of whiskey sourced whiskey spirits distilled from grain and sugar on the label and the word whiskey is nowhere to be seen but we ve stretched the definition before and this stuff tasted okay unaged smells like oak candy wrapped in fresh leaves a bit hot but like warm cereal on the tongue and the oak fills in the back sippable and likely to make a good old-fashioned as well fresh grains and sawn oak on the nose with some green grass and stalks spicy fresh flavors of corn and oak along with a doughy softness that contrasts with the 48% abv heat there s a somewhat bosky note of leaves and duff a salty cracker component and a medicinal hint the almost herbal complexity i ve come to expect from coppersea interesting tasty well off the beaten bourbon path new distillery in lancaster penn locally sourced grain copper pot still unaged rich new-make smell warm full grain rye oil and anise light spirit sweet more grain and a character like pizzelles sweet crisp anise cookies easily enjoyed with a finish of more sweet grain and anise interestingly schnapps-like given the area s german roots the nose of this mahogany-hued single-malt  portends dense and chewy flavors of brown sugar dates and toasted walnuts it s a bit fiery on the palate where it unleashes a rush of dried fruits smoke and spice while some raw spirit character peeks through this unconventional whiskey holds appeal for its originality with a stout-like crescendo of coffee and mocha on the very long finish strong bold aromas of rye grain fruit raspberries black grapes and dry cinnamon punchy rye on the tongue starts 42% tame but quickly catches fire roaring toward a barnburner of a finish as the fire dies down you find cocoa and rye oil in the embers this young 12 month rye is small-barrel shouty but the roots are good solid effort pale gold in color generous oak imparts honeycomb white chocolate vanilla custard and some mint notes that hint of a delicate pretty bourbon the palate is a bit deeper displaying chocolate berry fruit and bit-o-honey candy quite confectionary with sweet marshmallow fluff a pleasing and interesting whiskey worth trying but feels just a bit disjointed the nose features strong rye spice accompanied by sharp young oak along with black pepper graphite and a touch of green apple the entry is much heavier and sweeter than you d expect from such a young whiskey things quickly change in the mid-palate with a spice blast of cinnamon black pepper rye and oak a solid dash of heat gives the mid-palate some kick and drives a short dry finish some nice ideas hampered by the reality of youth a non-age stated single malt from washington state light amber in color there s more oak on the nose than you d expect along with baked apple chocolate cinnamon and clove chocolate leads the entry followed by clove cinnamon baked apple and salt a spicy mid-palate picks up some ginger and a dash of heat the finish is fairly short and dry this feels a bit young and lacks depth an interesting start lets see where it goes from here light straw color but its rich aroma contradicts its youthful color marshmallow and cotton candy really come out strong quickly followed by decadent bakery aromas fresh-baked muffins heavy whipping cream and vanilla icing with hints of caramelized barley and nutmeg its weaknesses are a slightly adhesive mouthfeel and short finish but the pronounced flavors still make it a borderline sipper or a just-add-water whiskey sourced whiskey mashbill of 47% corn followed by rye wheat and barley aromas of golden fruit with grassy freshness hay and floral notes turn a bit more plump and juicy on the palate with apricot raspberry and some tropical fruitâpineapple and mangoâemerging orange-peel citrus character is lifted by white pepper spice before the oak-laden leathery drying finish aged up to 5 years this whiskey serves up lots of fresh oaky sawdust with its caramel and toffee along with some varnish notes aromas of spice and smoke lead to a palate of butterscotch smooth and oily in texture with robust warming spice and a dry leathery and tannic finish nice maturity and polish for the price generously woody with pencil shavings and lumber mingled with chamomile white flowers and vanilla on the nose the light-bodied palate is sweet and floral with cloying milk chocolate toasted coconut and vanilla flavors it s just a bit simple and boring\r\n",

      "processing distilled in indiana and aged in new charred oak barrels then put through a compression aged process using new charred oak pieces wheat whiskey finished in huckleberry port barrels showing a deep reddish blush purple-pink around the edges the fruity richness of the portwood is subdued but present and lays across everything else in the nose things become less one-dimensional on the palate and the sweet broad grassiness of the wheat lightens the portwood influence somewhat but it comes back in the finish it s a decent combo but a bit of a one-note song price is per 375ml the second craft rye i m revisiting mosby s is still 100% organic rye and unaged but the nose is more fun some green pear and melon esters in there with the grassy rye spice it s nicely smooth on the tongue delivers exactly what the nose promised plus a shot of fresh-cracked black pepperâ¦and a much longer finish these days greatly improved a good white whiskey young malt whisky a rich but jumbled nose cocoa ripe grape oak and vanilla tumble and fight for your attention a nicely rounded lighter whiskey in the mouth though and the cocoa cradles malt sweetness quite nicelyuntil the oak tears up the finish with a blast of hot spice you almost want to keep sipping continuously to keep the finish from cutting in price is per 375ml mashbill of corn smoked barley rye and wheat and a ruddy almost garnet color to it smells like barrel drool in a rickhouse kinda raunchy and sweet with broad notes of vanilla and hot corn quite a mouthful at 100 proof and after a short initial wave of sweet the smoke shouts through squeezing and wringing the other flavors dry right through the finish water makes it paradoxically hotter quite dark brown in the glass and lots of vanilla and fruit - white grapes pear - in the nose with a sweet clean floral character as well a rich nose vibrant with malt and vanilla in the mouth rather hot without water and shot through with oakspice which dominates the finish though the vanilla struggles through water helps the heat in the middle but not the finish texas is pretty darned hot a restrained nose of fresh-cut oak grassy rye and a fleeting trace of solvents quite sweet in the mouth spicy and minty and the alcohol is fiery this is young rye still its much less forward and rudely insistent than id expected not at all the ripsnorter some young ryes are this could be pleasant but the finish is a letdown sweet mealy uninspiring aged in new charred oak then finished in white wine-seasoned french oak tight sawdusty bitter nose a lot of wood here going in different directions first hit is the american oak vanilla rich spice followed quickly by creamy french oak then comes a wave of fruity wine wood character full in the mouth and a thick finish interesting but not particularly well integrated maybe a case of just because you can doesn t mean you should sourced whiskey there s a hot brittle nose of sweet spice like a cinnamon red hot floating in alcohol with a softer backing of cornmeal underneath this is a well-behaved bourbon in the mouth no off-flavors easy to hold on the tongue with more corn than spice now and a lack of wood until the finish when it wraps in on the corn to dry things up a bit simple sweet a little spicy and really easy to drink a good start like the other taos lightning rye there s an mgp provenance that s topped with local aging it is stated to be a 5 year old whiskey there s the signature brittle-dry mint of this mashbill some hot oak and shortbread the mouth is quick spicy and hot but not over-balanced in any direction good but not setting off the shock and awe an estate white whiskey the corn in this spirit was all grown and harvested on the myer farm a finger lakes farm dating back to the 1860s the nose is clean and green a focused blast of unmodified corn the spirit is zesty and fresh sweet and grassyminty easy to hold on the tongue until a final heat that fires the finish if the finish were a bit smootherâ¦still quite good for unaged whiskey unaged corn whiskey from philadelphia the distinctive white corn spirit smell crushed corn leaves wet cornmeal hint of fruit and split stone a singular flavor though the usual flabby green sweetness isn t here instead there s a dry solid corn flavor something that tastes complete arrived i could ask for more complexity but the focused dry intensity of it has a singular appeal asking only ice - or a lager chaser - to make a great afternoon made in washington state with washington barley in a copper pot still and aged over a year in new charred 10 gallon oak barrels good color nose is frisky and young with fresh oak and big pear aromas and a hot feel hot and direct in the mouth grainy some of that pear and a somewhat bland but appealing cereal sweetness finish is more of the same with a flick of heat at the end aggressive nose of bitter orange dark chocolate and pine comes boiling out of the glass more gentle on the palate the same notes but wrapped in sweet malt a bit hot and crinkly on the tongue an assertive whisky but it fades quickly at the end good flavor but a lack of depth everything defiant has is right there on top there s nothing to discover the pine is off-putting too not sure where that s coming from clean nose hard grain some grassy sweetness a bit perfumey interesting on the tongue grain sweet orange and meadow grass has a pleasantly creamy texture gets just a bit solvent-touched at the finish but overall an interesting sipâ¦which brings up the question again what are these white whiskeys  for? cocktails highballs neat sipping? this one i think could pull off all three the kind of white whiskey that compares to white rum sourced whiskey made by ex-dickel distiller john lunn at the brands new distillery a new bottling new name distilled from grain and sugar smells like clean white dog warm ripe melon alcohol heat grain smoothly drinkable not hot or astringent simple sweet melon cooked grain sweeter than vodka and a bit more flavorful but otherwise pretty similar i still dont get the attraction sharp nose of fresh wet grain hot honey a little butterscotch crushed boxwood leaves and a touch of linseed an herbal smell mouth is roundly sweet with honey and pie crust notes that meet the oak and pretty it up there s mint here which surprised me maybe from the wood? this one s dainty delicate and maybe a bit too sweet but it maintains an edge of oak that keeps it serious price is per 375 ml malt whiskey with a mashbill similar to a craft-brewed stoutâthink dark roasted maltsâand then aged in new charred oak with an addition of toasted french oak the nose is sweet young malt touched with chocolate there s an additional hit of cocoa at first taste then heat oak vanilla and more sweet malt followed by a finish that s increasingly chocolatey and dry young and could use more complexity and maturing but full of good flavors price is per 375 ml deep golden in color with a pinkish cast this shows good purity of fruit with red berry black cherry toasty oak and some oxidative nutty notes layered across a creamy malty palate a nice grilled-fruit palate echoes with sweetness and charcoal smoke on the long finish the sherry contributes a lot of nice character but without more overall maturity feels a bit like window dressing unaged richly sweet with corn and a bit of new make funk replicated very closely on the tongue alcohol heat corn sweetness wild flowersstems and faint notes of overripe fruit with some drying minerality on the finish interesting where it s not clean a balance of craft and cunning a coppery auburn color betrays small barrels in this case just ten gallons the distinctive aroma of sassafras recalls rolling in a pile of autumn leaves then quickly gives way to the apparent spice of a high-rye mashbill the earthy and spicy qualities meld nicely developing cedar box and sandalwood wrapped in the sweetness of maple syrup while the palate feels slick and buttery before a finish lingering with cinnamon and warm oatmeal cookie corn and oak on the nose with a slice of fruit from sherry cask aging nose is strikingly different from the other two hillrocks reviewed sweeter and softer it s clearly bourbon at the front but as the flavors move back in the mouth and into the finish the sherry takes over and dominates becoming quite fruity at the close though with a firm grip of charred oak the sherry s too much for a bourbon especially at this price partially sourced whiskey part of this pittsburgh distillery s series of whims one-offs truly interesting nose a combination of new-barrel bourbon reek and irish raw barley grassiness yielding mint vanilla juicy wet grain and faint cinnamon hot entry of vanilla and small-barrel oak which suddenly collapses to a dry cocoa sweetness spiked with hot pepper like mexican chocolate this typifies a lot of craft efforts not a great whiskey now but one with terrifically interesting potential i hope wigle pursues this whim price is per 375 ml i reviewed a couple of these one-off wigle whims earlier this one s quite roasty indeed almost coffee-like made with roasted barley and wheat and caramel and chocolate malts it smells of burnt grain with sweet toffee underneath lots of chocolate and cocoa struggle with ash and burnt grain leading to a hot finish where they end up finally in agreement a smoky mocha mouthful espresso whiskey invigorating price is per 375 ml onyx east hartford conn ages their moonshine in new charred oak barrels to make this expressionâ  nose is fresh-sawn oak and sugar cookies with a bit of cinnamon spice tons of fresh oak in the mouth id guess this is small-barrel whiskey with a spicy sweetness a hallmark of young craft whiskey as is the quick finish still no real flaws and pleasant enough mgp-sourced bourbon is finished in madeira barriques and shows a nicely reddish color nose is corn and wine gums not hot not sweet flash-hot in the mouth light body and some candy and minerality with the corn a prickly heat and acidity at the end but overall more pleasant than that sounds label says dunkel release says dunkelweizen two very different beers mostly strong sawn oak on the nose with some clove so maybe dunkelweizen is closer springy spicy and a bit oily on the tongue german gingerbread on the finish 375 ml made with 100% rye aged up to 5 years this starts off surprisingly fruit-forward with poached pear and zesty clove-pierced citrus though the wood is beginning to dominate the palate fires up the rye spice underscored by cocoa turning hot with some adhesive notes and finishing with fresh cereal grain and bitter oak tannins a wood lover s whiskey pretty fruit gets swept up in distinct anise and fennel-bulb aromas with hints of mint and quinine backed by vanilla very soft creamy and rounded on the palate the peachy stone fruit comes nicely balanced with oak sweet vanilla and glimmers of nutmeg and clove spices before the cocoa powder finish well-constructed smooth and easy-drinking with a pleasant persistence of fruit the oak is nicely subdued and integrated here allowing buttered fruits to show throughâbaked spiced apple and poached pearâlaced with spearmint and bay leaf the creamy palate is nicely balanced with baking spices of cinnamon and clove and hints of pepper giving way to a pleasantly drying chalky finish price is per 375 ml very oaky with a nose of fresh sawdust but beneath lurk deep maple sweetness pralines and cherry cough drop the palate is chewy sweet and nutty with pleasing caramel and butterscotch but is hurt by some peculiar varnish and furniture polish notes finishes with cherry leather and more oak the rye spice on the nose is big broad and aromatic with allspice and clove in the mix but there are some distillation issues with a slight rubber-tire note of feints rich and viscous on the palate it s slightly hot but shows really lovely spice and toasted nuts turning oak-dominated on the finish sweet and simple candied nose palate is thin bright and lemony like a fluffy mouthful of sweet marshmallows with hints of banana circus peanuts candy and gingery spice not especially complex but pleasant enough layers of sweetness concentrated vanilla marshmallow taffy white chocolate and caramel subtle underlying fruit palate again the layers of sweetness but not to the point of being cloying or unpleasant-underlying notes of oak and minty resinous spices emerge mid-palate and cut through the sweetness to keep it from dominating too much sweet and spicy finish \r\n",
      " a special batch of stranahan s aged in hungarian oak the distillery is doing a lot of experimenting with aging their whiskey in different wine barrels i really like how this one turned out nicely sweet with honey-drenched fruit golden raisin cotton candy caramel apple jordon almonds and grape skins good grip -- and a little funky -- on the finish nothing too assertive though which cuts through the sweetness not a polished whiskey but certainly an adventure available only at the distillery take the charbay r5 clear and add some vanilla and toast notes interesting the flavorsâ¦on first sip the mellowing richness of the oak makes for a nice entry but the wood blunts the zip of the hoppy beer wash without adding enough to compensate for the loss and makes for a hotter finish it s still interesting but the wood gets in the way of what this can be sweet crisp nose apple mint wintergreen grainy in the mouth sweet bready flavors the whiskey coats the mouth but more in an obscuring way it seems to get between you and the flavors it is quite smooth compared to young bourbons but it leaves me looking for more overall impression is of a sweeter younger whiskey that needs to mature and the clean character makes me think maturity would look good on it wow thats a small barrel whiskey only 2 years old and more like 12 years dark with a nose stuffed full of oak char steamy mint and hot vanilla you know its wheat in the mouth despite the aggressive nose and the heat you do get this is still pretty friendly stuff for 50% sweet dough mint and more oak but the finish roars in real hot and a bit astringent ruining the moment and water doesnt help a hot wash of vanilla and sweet cloves and cinnamon with shouty alcohol heat and a log of oak whatever else this is subtle  is not on the menu wow is that hot in the mouth still it s flavorful with it cinnamon candy and corn on the cob gush onto the palate there are some cobby notes though and a bit of mustiness the finish isâsurpriseâhot and fades reluctantly doc bryson prescribes more time in a large barrel aged 6 to 7 months in quarter barrels sharpish oaky nose with a sweet graingolden syrup backing spirity in the mouth with a big slap of young oak up front that quickly subsides yielding sweet corn muffin white pepper and dry cocoa that linger into the finish hot but worth the burn some nice components here age and a bigger barrel could do a better job on integration a blend of aged sourced bourbon and great lakes  own young malt whiskey quite sweet on the nose a rich herbal sweetness with a strong youthful quality to it interestingly medicinal on the tongue as the herbal character swells a full mouthfeel with clear references to new make about it a bit oily grassy and bright the finish is the best part minty and a bit drying a pleasant farewell interesting concept quite mild on the nose for 99 proof dry oak light honey crisp corn it all fires up in the mouth a thick wash of hot oak and cornâattic whiskeyâwhite pepper and a tongue-crinkling woodiness leading to a drying finish that leaves you thirsty and swallowing as it fades this may only be 6 years old according to the label but they were hot years better with a bit of water sourced whiskey sweet and a bit funky maybe a wisp of smoke maybe some green cornstalk and some mintvanilla rippling and vibrant in the mouth hot and bold and not candy-sweet at all more like fuel-injected cornbread with a splash of burning mint eau de vie across the top or maybe that s just the acdc talking maybe i should review to mozart not bad but i think i like the simpler unaged version fresh and distinctly grain driven like slurping warm breakfast cereal but that malt purity also comes at the expense of complexity and development with lots of grassy meadow cut hay notes that lead to a palate of husky grain and honeyed malt before a finish sweet young grass notes all local colorado malt with a little peat-smoked malt unaged no smoke on the nose fresh a bit feinty wet and juicy melon a hint of cardamom smoke is there as it hits the tongue immediate but gentle spirit tastes much cleaner than it smells hot on the tongue prickly more melon and spice on the finish a bit creamy not a bad white but quite pricey price is per 375 ml despite the orange-amber color green stalky corn husk and bramble notes dominate this youngster with secondary flavors of fruitwood smoke and warm cereal the flavors are beginning to evolve nicely on the palate as the fresh malt meets lots of dark chocolate before a savory snap of green stick returns on the finish malted barley malted rye and malted wheat simple nose of corn oak cinnamon candy and ash candy sweet grainy still simple and a bit thin increasingly hot at the end needs more breadth and depth but there s nothing seriously flawed i d characterize this as a good flyweight boxer caught in a cruiserweight bout nice footwork solid performance and dealing some good hits but the bigger older bourbons give it a palate-pounding price is per 375 ml a seven stills and pacific brewing laboratory collaboration a distilled double ipa broiled grapefruit and caramel with a razory lightness but a bit muddled flavors of sweet malt and maple pierced in a needle-row with bitter hop resins pine pith malthopmalthop comes in quick waves like some double ipas this is a blunt instrument that simply walks up and wallops you with hops and malt neither subtle nor particularly complex hop fans may well love it others will not price is per 375 ml the first legal rye from delaware since prohibition includes 65% rye and also 5% rye malt although showing some spirituous aromas of youth this is one of the more precocious small barrel projects 10 gallon with its sweet cinnamon candy and rye bread notes turning still spicier on the palate not terribly complex but enjoyable very sweet and simple aroma like plain jelly beans with only a whisper of the heat you d expect at 45% better on the tongue proper heat some cornpone a bed of oak smooth good balance good finish nothing stands out but nicely made loses points on the nose and typifies the small producer dilemma why bottle a good bourbon? beam and heaven hill do that already cheaper than you ever will sourced whiskey nose is a bit perfumed like doilies at grandmas house with grain grass and meadow notes flavor is minty rye-bitter and penetrating finish is sweet and hot with more grassiness powerful rye influence not much corn and that perfume note is odd but the rye is gripping a 100% rye unaged white whiskey nose is fruityâpear apple black raspberryâand peppery with a mineral edge to it like fresh-cracked stone creamy sweet mouth repeating the fruits in half-voice with a sharp alcoholic heat sweetness makes me curious about the fermentation attenuationâ¦but this would be good with seltzer the sb2rw stands for small batch small barrel rye whiskey smells like it small barrel fresh-cut oak smell clove cigarettes and a fair amount of heat a bit thin on the tongue with a medicinal bite of rye grass warming heat and some sweetness and the medicinal part expands into the finish beautiful little bottle and label 100% rye aged 2 years in 53-gallon heavy char oak barrels smells right rye spice orange candies and oaky vanilla light body quite hot and the sweetness comes through but the rye really turns it up as the liquid spreads on the tongue and warms some plastic hints high in the mouth promising but not there yet part of the problem with big barrels fresh oak nose with hard candies and bitter grass notes much less oaky on the tongue but the hard candiesâspicy-sweet a bit hotâburst in the mouth leading down to a warm pastry-sweet finish with a wreathing of ashes boozy and warm and a bit simple but quite drinkable for a young bourbon nose is tight closed what s there is like a raisin bun softly sweet pastry and dried fruit gentle in the mouth warming but not hot still like the pastry but with oak framing and some nuts and a hint of anise 375 ml starts off quite confectionary with sweet top notes of vanilla crã¨me caramel and violets the palate flaunts its brash youth showing lots of primary new make whiskey character while carrying its 100 proof surprisingly well for such a young whiskey aged less than 1 year as the cereal grain cinnamon spice generous sweetness and charcoal power through the palate young potent and unapologetic soft creamy and corn-driven with sweet stone fruit and char aromas up front the palate delivers on the nose simple direct and enjoyable pleasantly soft and creamy then turning slightly nutty with sweet praline sweetness and a touch of cocoa while lacking in complexity and verve it shows smoothness for a whiskey aged less than 2 years pleasantly aromatic of oranges and dusty oak turning more oily chewy and nutty on the palate with honeycomb intensity however the tannins are quite aggressive suggesting green walnut hulls and wooden popsicle stick grassy notes and damp hay define the aroma of this young bourbon while the palate offers good citrus and orchard fruits however there is a varnish note and stalky green character that hold it back needs time a small-barrel aged whiskey the nose is sweet and fairly simple cotton candy wintergreen faint menthol and some heat it s hot in the mouth too the mintwintergreen gives way to light caramel and sweet fudge it s even a bit sticky there s a need for more depth to balance the sweetness and some more age to mellow the heat more rough-edged than big distiller  whiskey at this point distilled from malted bavarian hard wheat on the still formerly used at germain-robin good pedigree does it deliver? breadflour in the aroma like a fresh bag of flour with a fruity alcohol edge to it the wheat tang i know from beer in the mouth it comes through as bread and crackers it s somewhat hot but it s a brandyaromatic heat vapor-producing the finish pulls more grain in finally they re aging some of this should be a great whiskey distilled from bottle-ready ipa sure is the hops leap out of the glass piney and pithy a real west coast beer and whiskey experience in a glass quite a fat mouthfeel for 99 proof a big oily thing that rolls around the tongue making itself at home with flaring hop flavor - not really bitter - and an underlying sweetness bittering kicks in on the finish an astonishing experience that really grows on youâ¦but ultimately there s a lack of depth price is per 1 liter as mentioned in my column this issue stillhouse is packaged in a stainless steel can much like the ones used for paint thinner labeled 100% corn whiskey clean scent of corn green corn stalks and apples very similar on the tongue with just a hint of burn for what it is this is not bad clean tasty definitely a good mixer they have several flavored versions as well sourced whiskey corn pudding and ryespice nose very plain-spoken with just the barest hint of berries flavors of light custard corn rye brown sugar light maple and vanilla ignite a fiery wash across the tongue with a fairly hot finish this is a delicate and subtle bourbon one that would be lost if mixed with something too big but rewarding when enjoyed neat nicely done an unusual style made from 100% wheat hints of stone fruit brown apples and molasses come cloaked in earthy aromas of saddle leather woodpile and husky grain shows well for its age and quite smooth but the oak dominates and aromas seem dulled with vanilla oak bitterness and dark chocolate on the finish interesting bottled by the tennessee spirits company pewaukee wi woody nose spiked with dry rye spiciness black pepper dried mint my that s hot it s a rye rocket and the wood s drying up every bit of sweet here leaving my tongue wrinkly a bit of water though and this is a much happier whiskey softer sweeter notes come out and the mint cheers up sourced whiskey distilled from an almost extinct strain of heirloom corn crooked creek this is a fully aromatic white whiskey fresh white corn crisp apple and pear float high over the liquid a soft mouthânot overly hotâbrings the fruit but the corn is a solid underpinning there s a dry almost mineral component to the finish no flaws interesting flavors and nicely integrated for an unaged spirit not a lot of details offered past the cane â¢ corn spirit and aged in oak for 2 years on the label and talk of a honey mixture color is medium-amber smell is thin sweet and lightly fruity not unpleasant in the mouth candy-sweet maybe a bit bland and an ashy hint the finish does have a little bit-o-honey  flavor that hangs high for a long time overall not bad but not real exciting either this whiskey pours light sweet and pure with fresh bread and honeyed malt up front while displaying some evident youth to the spirit the palate offers warm cereals floral notes bit-o-honey candy and malty sweetness on the palate not especially complex but delicate clean and pretty wood-smoked malt a spirit aged in oak with fruitwood chips added makes for a distinctive idiosyncratic whisky nose is warehouse reek mellow fruitwood smoke and sweet light pipe tobacco with a slight hint of cinnamon mouth is hot but soft with lots of malt and that unfamiliar flow of fruitwood smoke thin and edgy up front but as the smoke spreads and the malt sweetens it evolves finish is a bit abrupt furniture polish red raspberries popovers a vigorous nose going in several directions hot grainy mouth not overwhelmed by wood a simple grain finish like twice-baked biscuits with a light wreathing of meadow mint the character of the grain comes through quite clearly and it s distinctly different from the myer rye but what s here is not particularly interesting or well-integrated dry dusty corn with some fruit flashing around and an odd aroma of cracked limestone simple corn spirit lightly sweet and clean not hot especially for 50% and a smooth finish as the company notes this is a spirit for mixing but it s a surprisingly easy sipper if not overly rewarding unaged triple distilled spirit produced and bottled at piedmont distillers in north carolina clean nose with hints of unripe honeydew bond paper and wet crushed chalk very soft on the palate clean with no burn at all slippery-smooth a tiny bit sweet tastes like good vodka really not much grain here at all easy to drink butâ¦where s the excitement? mason jar packaging makes for an awkward pour had to be said nose is hot with a fruity sweetness and fainter notes of grassy green corn flowers and rock clean and sweet with more corn character here along with other fresh grains not nasty not bad but seems to be mostly aimed as a base for palmetto s apple pie and peach flavors otherwiseâ¦it s sweet corn-tinged vodka bottle 170 of this delaware distillery s first batch full oily aroma of sweet wet crushed corn almost too rich very clean on the palate light and sweet a bit of dry leafiness impressive first effort delaware only a locally-grown mashbill of 75% barley 20% malt 5% oats very aromatic for unaged spirit fresh grainy a bit feintyvegetal split rock and a note like well-rinsed crisp sauerkraut it s a quick and lively one in the mouth sweet and slippery grain and hints of fresh herbs fennel mace white peppercorn the finish is a bit stickyâthe oats maybeâand sweet interesting stuff a blend of 94% rye-mash whiskey and virgil kanes high-rye bourbon 60% corn 36% rye and 4% barley floral rye grain spice bursts from the nose along with cedar plank and graphite the entry is thick and sweet with maple syrup young oak and rye spice things dont heat up until the end of the mid-palate where a dash of heat drives a long spicy finish an interesting mix of flavors that could benefit from a little more complexity another experimental whims bottlings this one is 95% malted rye and 5% malted barley nose is sharp with notes of cinnamon candies and a bit of solvents better on the palate a cooling breeze of minty rye some citrus and growing bitter rye oil as it finishes fairly simple pleasant stuff but the nose is not inviting price is per 375 ml a whiskey distilled from rye malt mash which indicates aging in used barrels still has a deep coloring from port barrel finishing nose is quite peppery youthfully vegetal and sweet with fruit again presumably from the port barrel rye grassiness and spice in the mouth wrapped with layers of port fruit and pepperiness that roll into the finish smooth for the strength though the port is pushy and the flavors could be better balanced an interesting direction well they got the proof right from jem beverage carrollton texas sweet cedar and citrus in the nose dominant and one-noted sweet on the tongue with that fresh green cedar character and more sweet citrus a touch of oak in the finish not a lot else the name is a reference to the whiskey convention this is a malt spirit aged in a used american rye whiskey barrel light amber light nose of bakers chocolate barrel fruit candy and boiled frosting spicy and prickly on the tongue the rye? with calming influence from the barrel a lively swallow sweet spicy a whack of cut lumber and the sweetness of young malt but theres a roughness thats not all fun good spirit needs more taming unaged spirit and smells like it rich grain a bit of loose-cut funkiness quite sweet in the mouth more body than usual some oiliness hints of cocoa and pastry and a hint of something like bamboo shoots not as clean as some unaged spiritbut not as dull as some either riffing on the german smoked beer type light smoke and caramel on the nose very grassy front the smoke slips in toward the middle and it all ends up a bit confused like dessert served in an ashtray 375 ml rich copper in color following just 55 weeks in a 17-gallon barrel at low proof 1062 this whiskey is caught between youth and ambition as flavors of leathery oak earth dried apple and dates emerge to meet green twigs and briar and some musty basement generous and broad-shouldered this rye aims high with solid structure and robust spice but is overwhelmed by dusty bitterly tannic oak on the finish made from 100% malted barley wash from the adjacent flying dog brewery and aged for a minimum of two years surprisingly good for such a young whisky layers of sweetness honey caramel toffee with some nuttynougat notes bourbon-like charred oak and background spice some youthful burn emerges toward the latter half of the palate -- a little careful aging would smooth out the finish and add depth still a very nice effort sweet corn along with caramel vanilla and more subtle ripe summer fruits on the nose and palate light slightly brash finish rather sweet somewhat youthful tasting straight-forward and unpretentious not something i would be drinking neat but it does fare better on the rocks the ice and cold water cut through and calm the sweetness i think a little more aging would add some depth and balance some of the sweetness with more oak spice lots of char and burnt sugar on the nose leading to some sweet fruit on the palate with coffee and mocha on the finish vanilla cream candies are overwhelmed by a woodpile of oak drying tannins and heat that lack balance multiple tastings with consistent results new make from the same mashbill as evan williams bottled straight from the still much higher proof than the others but not noticeably hotter in the nose that s light corn and grass with a bit of minty spice hotter in the mouth but quite pleasant and evolving fresh mint gives way to light corn then a slightly oily slip to brisk sweetnessâ¦and you realize you didn t notice the serious overproof a well-behaved white dog an odd touch of the roasted-grain smell of the dryhouse here then youthful whiskey underneath it sweet mint barrel flavors tumble across the tongue cocoa mint coconut grass and a bit of spice this is six months in the barrel and its good for that i also like that its all montana-grown grain but you have to wonder what it will be like after another four years white whiskey amazing legs on the glass classic white dog nose green corn estery fruits a bit sharp but not burny hot clean taste of corn spirit no off flavors and very well-mannered for 50% unaged whiskey i can hold this on my tongue easily and there are some good bits of sweet candy as it rolls off nicely done aromas hint at a bitterly astringent almost burnt sugar smell like green walnut hulls while the body is full and rich it s simply too hot and young to make for pleasant drinking the finish is long and spicy but needs more time to mellow there s the sweet reek of new make barely ripe apricot and peach green grain a hint of spice the spirit is surprisingly dry with shots of grain pepper and some clean alcohol notes on the top but a well-mannered 100 proof indeed and easy to hold on the tongue there s a dry twist of anise on the finish an interesting - and promising - white whiskey pennsylvania only the american craft whiskey movement has produced some unique riffs on classic spirits here we get a classic irish-type whiskey made in tennessee and aged in small 15-gallon barrels it s all lush irish on the nose with caramel green apple dark chocolate oak on the palate the oak from the small barrel overtakes caramel apple with its smoky barrel char sawdust and clove spice an interesting idea but perhaps better realized in larger or used barrels the malt was lightly smoked with a 6040 mix of apple and cherry woods it is very light in the nose which gives a fruitbowlâapple white grape pearâtopped with wet malt and just a hint of that smoke very hot as expected but the smoke is more pronounced with a creamy texture water brings out more malt and notes of cocoa ripe red delicious apple and nutsâ¦and a somewhat rough finish interesting and mixable quite dark for 4 year old whiskey nose is fierce unrestrained by the glass and full of caramel baking spices and dusty corn it s hot and oaky but dominated by a broad cornmeal placidity that keeps the flaming oak well in check water brings out mint but brings a cloying edge to the corn it s better hot and rocking a huge evaporative loss made for a tiny yield but even so the price just seems crazy fiery young stuff the nose is spicyslicey with a sharp sweetness fresh oak and a hint of solvent a lot of oak in the mouth almost drying and just a bit astringent on the tongue the finish turns softer sweeter but stays oaky the wood s a bit overwhelming on this one it s sourced whiskey that s then finished in long island wine barrels some finishes work better than others another green malt whiskey from coppersea a method they found in an old scottish text for making whiskey from unkilned malt this is much more vegetal than the rye reviewed in summer 2014 rank grass aroma with a sweetness behind it without the lovely complexity of the rye bitter and stemmy hot and sweet as it closes i much prefer the rye craft beer whiskey mashbill of 80% malt20% rye malt fermented with a belgian ale yeast that yields spicy aromas nose is mostly young oak like a small barrel whiskey but there are some subtle spice notes and sweet malt creamy mouth sweet but not sticky and the orange and spice i m picking up are likely from that yeast body is luscious best part of the whiskey because the finish turns prickly there s promise here but delivery s delayed price is per 375 ml distilled from an oatmeal stout with a shot of peat this intrigued even before the cap popped it does smell like an oatmeal stout cocoa grains fresh bread restrained smoke mixed with small-barrel oak the smoke blows up in the mouth much more evident and the chocolaty honey-sweet base rolls underneathâ¦but it s shallow without the richness of a properly-aged scotch craft whiskeys want to grow up so fast but this is like a kid in his dad s clothes 400 bottles only price is per 375 ml generously oaky with sawdust horse saddle vanilla honey and a chalky mineral quality on the nose the palate is mouth-coating with a full-bodied punch of sweet fruit caramel treacle and heat but even with dilution the astringent wood tannins chalk dust and dry leathery finish come on too quickly the rare craft bourbon that might have been better a bit younger loch & key exclusive light brown sugar orange candy and cinnamon on the nose along with just a hint of funk electric in the mouth zapping out to every corner and tooth with bitter oils and hot alcohol with a backing wall of corn sweetness the finish is almost a relief take the rattlesnake graphic as a warning this ones not kidding the bottle states aged less than four years but the nose says probably less than two unseasoned oak and sawdust dominate the nose if you can get through the oak you ll find honey corn cinnamon and beef jerky on the palate it s dry cornmeal caramel and a hefty portion of abrasive oak the mid-palate is big spice with cinnamon black pepper clove and oak a short dry finish puts a bow on a whiskey that s overly tannic dry and oaky fruit driven with banana and circus peanuts candies florals and violet candies this turns more peppery and minty on the palate where warm cereal meets some varnish notes with a bit of heat and slight bitterness that makes it feel a bit rough around the edges 100% montana and canada rye aged 2 years in full-sized barrels woodsy wet leaves and fallen trees dry grain bin and fresh-cut cherrywood aromas cherry and dark plum up front passing through to cocoa and wood and chocolate-cherry candy on the endnone of which tastes like anything id call bourbon until the very last whisper of the finish how do you make bourbon without a hint of corn or oak to it? some strange ideas here small barrel-type aromas sharp fresh oak and hot grain but also cocoa hulls and coffee grounds tastes youthfully hot and chocolatey and sweet and the oak is raw and forward more chocolate than stout i think 375 ml distilled from corn malted barley rye and flaked rye and aged in small barrels with toasted orangewood chips while this whiskey smacks of its youth with green flavors of burnt cane stalks wrapped in orange blossom honey and charred marshmallow there is something compelling about its primary spirit quality freshness and sincerity a fine example of what it aims to beâyoung small-barrel whiskey initial aromas of boiled corncob sugarcane stalks and burnt sugar give a suggestion of youth and slight bitterness dig a little deeper and the secondary flavors of honeyed fruit green apple lavender vanilla and fresh oak reveal potential while clearly young there is still a lot to admire in this soft and delicate wheated bourbon with its hints of smoke and a mouthwatering saltwater taffy finish possibly derived from aging in floating boathouses on puget sound 375ml big bottom finishes their light-style barlow trail whiskey in 10 year old tawny port casks on the nose its promising with oak blackberry jam orange vanilla and rye spice the entry is soft and light with vanilla and berry but it shifts dramatically in the mid-palate which is exceptionally spicy and dry big bottom s previous port cask finishes have been blockbusters but the light-style barlow trail whiskey doesnt have the same level of balance and integration to prevail does this belong here at 70% cane sugar and 30% cornwheat? the process sure looks like whiskey so we ll let it slip in the aroma s sweet but with a solvent rim to it for 105 proof this is pretty smooth stuff in the mouth there are notes of melon and green corn and a wet hint of fresh grass before the burner kicks on at the finish it s a hot end on this one but not unpleasant new make fruitâpear stewed appleâand rye spice in a hot clean nose that s pretty much what you get in the mouth too with some dry paper notes and a sweet finish for some reason i really want to try mixing this with dr pepper this is definitely a mixing spirit mountain-style small barrel whiskey 100% corn rich sweet oaky nose withâat firstânotes of peppermint and rice krispies treats nose collapses and becomes sharp woody burnt fiery mouth smoky notes dry wood and hot mint are overwhelming and somewhat astringent finish lingers much longer than would be pleasant hot and tingly with a redeeming core of corn tastes like it was pushed hard to be done lots of green notes in the nose of this mason jar variety of moonshine including green apple green bean and wheat grass strong brewer s yeast and cornmeal round things out in a highly aromatic nose for the proof the entry is remarkably soft and sweet tasting like buttered cornbread fire and spice aren t far behind with black pepper white pepper and charred cracker jack long dry and slightly hot finish with a hint of popcorn and green bean like the whim mocha porter this is certified organic a wheat whiskey made with locally-grown hops hard to tease out hops vs small barrel oak spice in the nose it s bold and shouty wow the hops are explosive in the mouth flashing bitter on the tongue the first sip was shocking now it s settling in and becoming smoother but i just don t think this much hops is a good idea in a whiskey price is per 375 ml caramel brown sugar vanilla generic sweetness smooth entry and more of the same on the tongue with some alcohol heat in the finish very little wood at all begging to be poured into coke maybe most jarring is that the hatfield & mccoy brand recalls the infamous feud that took place on the kentucky-west virginia borderâ¦while this was distilled in south carolina at least the label s honest as far as that sourced whiskey plainly states it s aged four months in a small oak barrel tame nose working hard to pull out anything other than alcohol heat some fresh-cut wet wood and wet cereal quite hot with lots of wet oak sawdust and sweet cinnamon that rocket right into the finish reminds me of a young teenager running around shouting at inappropriate moments and very excited too young and hot right now put it back in the barrel maybe a larger one price is per 375 ml this young peated malt aged at least 24 months has a nice dry peat smoke nose backed by honey and oak on the palate it s disjointed the young peat malt argues with the heavy char barrel a struggle that needs more time to be worked out honeyed malt tries to lend support but everything topples in the mid-palate where things turn dry spicy and slightly acidic a medium finish wraps up a whiskey that simply needs more time buttered popcorn combines with wet pavement vanilla and black pepper for an interesting but edgy nose the entry is light and sweet with vanilla and buttered corn and a silky smooth mouthfeel the mid-palate thins things out a bit and shifts focus to strong black pepper this black pepper drives a spicy and dry finish many white whiskies straddle the line between whisky and vodka and this one edges a little too close to the vodka space pale gold in color this whiskey is noticeably cloudy even in a warm room swifts nose is pleasant with malt honey and butterscotch the entry is exceptionally thin with a hint of malt and honey but theres not much to it in the mid-palate it s all about the bourbon barrel so much so that the overall character shifts toward corn whiskey a short finish with chocolate notes wraps up a whiskey that just doesn t have much to say there s promise here with peach dried apricot baking spice and vanilla delighting the olfactory and a slight hint of coffee just in case you needed it but the intense heat shows itself and grain covers subtle sweetness and spice the best high-proof whiskeys are actually quite smooth this needs water to find its sweet spot sourced whiskey barely-aged white whiskey light sharp fruit brighter than the high west single malt a brittle sweetness new-make greenness quite smooth even a bit creamy with a light float of vanilla and a hit of grain in the middle it all wafts away on a razor-edged cloud of a finish smooth for a white but id like more substance crisps the nose hairs a bit but it s pure corn even a bit of cornbread tip a sip in and it s nothing but more green corn sweet fresh - hot for sure but not overwhelming - and pretty tasty for what it is with white whiskey we re walking the fine line between flavor and raw wound at all times and this one finds the line smelling the rye from a foot away after pouring exceptionally clean aroma of grain the oilyspicy rye notes come through clearly quite smooth not a lot of flavors very focused on the rye itself with grain and just a touch of mint a long finish with sweet grain that slowly turns to mint in the end single barrel cask proof strong wood aromas pencil shavings hot-sawn oak hot and tight intense wood there s some interesting stuff around the edges but the wood s blocking it till some sweetness peeks through at the end water helps a little but not enough over-barreled there s a somewhat oily faint green look to this in the bottle strong aroma of corn some green apple and a faint hint of smoke and wet dog tastes a bit medicinal with a smoky richness and a surprisingly full mouthfeel sweet finish adds to the general impression that this one needs cleaned up a bitâ¦or demands a different approach berkshire mountain distillers uses locally grown corn here aged on local oak and cherry wood the nose is sweet and sharp smelling of corn grass and tart cherries corn and ash dominate the hot slippery mouth with a finish that turns sweeter as it dwindles with some faint fruit notes but the heat is hard to overcome if it were my corn i d put it into the bourbon instead this is a bit thin palmetto distillery has been making moonshine  products so far and now they have some spirit aged in new french oak aromas of sweet pastry dough new rubber horehound and bitter orange make for an intriguing nose the mouth is fiery hot thin in body and tends to stay that way through to the end the horehound blends with rye bitterness to make this a bit medicinal hot for sipping but should make a very good old fashioned extremely dark color aged in ten-gallon barrels a thick burbling nose full of dark aromas smoke molasses earth and moist tobacco with a sharp woody twist around the outside the mouth recapitulates much of that but in a brighter fashionâ¦and then the small barrel takes over tight intense wood that blows out everything else and leaves the tongue tingling i find it hard to tease out any spirit character what s this whiskey taste like under the wood? although this moonshine may look down-home in a mason jar it was produced using the highly technical terrepure process designed to remove most congeners the result is a corn neutral spirit that doesn t smell or taste much like corn instead it s soft vanilla toasted marshmallow and a dash of salt a little heat and white pepper round things out for a long peppery-dry finish it s pretty good for a vodka but is it really moonshine or white whiskey? probably not from terrepure there s that reassuring note on the label that the whiskey is aged at least six months nose is somewhat flat compressed diner mints old cinnamon sticks cattle feed tastes thin sweet hot and not very complex there s a flash of something more just before the swallow corn hot mint but it vanishes in a bland quick finish uninspiring if surprisingly smooth for 6 month old whiskey aged one day in new american oak this white dog ekes out the very minimum requirements for bourbon the nose is heavy barnyard complete with hay horse and manure beyond the funk is cornmeal cashew and apple blossom the palate is light and what youd expect with yeasty cornbread sour apple apple blossom and black pepper the funk is still there but not as intense as on the nose interesting overall character with aging potential but for now it s unbaked smoked with a maceration of lapsang souchong tea which leaves some fine sediment thickly sweet and herbal nose in a ruddy whiskey like a sweetened aged genever on the palate this 70% 7 year old mgp corn 30% unaged two james rye is woody and ash-bitter in the core with a wrapping of that sweetness the herbal character saves it from the squabble between sweet and bitter but it comes off more as a tonic than a whiskey campfire smoke fusel notes green twigs and rhum agricole give a rustic edge to this big and broad-shouldered whiskey full-bodied with an attitude the sweet clover honey oily characterâ  and lingering burnt sugar bitterness feel a bit disjointed pot distilled and aged in charred oak for 3 years there is a certain rusticity here with a nose rooted in rhum agricole sweet malt honeycomb butterscotch and molasses tinged with furniture polish and varnish notes the palate is sweet and candied with bit-o-honey circus peanuts and nougat turning a touch chocolatey on the finish a special limited edition release of early times whisky described as old style sour mash on the label simple straight-forward notes of soft vanilla sweet corn light caramel golden raisin and with some coaxing subtle anise youthful on the palate with a rather harsh oak finish i m happy for the celebration but a bit disappointed with the whisky two bottles of this the volume equivalent of one standard 750 ml bottle will set you back about $24 and there are many superior whiskies at this price point price is per 375ml bottle light amber color no age statement not labeled as straight whiskey nose of spiced hard candies wet oak mint very hot mouth thin body muddled flavors of candy and wood quite young with a hot unpleasant finish the unaged lovell bros is both more enjoyable and more interesting wood tannins are an interesting thing used correctly they can help create spice depth and complexity as well as define a spirits character unrestrained tannins can wreak havoc that s what s happened with this whiskey sharp unfinished wood defines a nose that is raw in every sense a thin entry struggles to present maple and caramel before a heavy blast of oak tannins decimates them those tannins define the rest of the taste experience including a sour and bitter finish with a mash featuring no less than six different kinds of malt and aged in four different barrels two sherry a bourbon and heavy-char new american oak there are lot of moving parts with this whiskey a jammy inviting nose features blackberry jam raisin apricot and ginger on the palate it s a cacophonic mess chocolate and peated malt clash and do battle to grab focus add some heavy char and sherry to the mix and its a bloodbath aged in a combination of 25-gallon and 53-gallon barrels florida s first bourbon since prohibition is 16 to 28 months of age the honor of being first comes with compromisesâa youthful spirited profile with clear distillate lurking just beneath the heavy surface oak dried fruit and cocoa notes slightly hot earthy and leathery with robusta coffee and oak astringency on the finish this is new make from the rittenhouse rye mashbill unaged right off the still yeasty mash notes come through strongly with a big nose of rye and corn underneath it smells fresh and alive wow that s powerful stuff much hotter than the trybox corn this one is on fire with rye spice it s got me breaking a sweat a bit of water brings out more grain notes and some tempering sweetness but it s still no pussycat cleanly powerful provocative spelt s an interesting aroma grainy and a bit earthy with hints of golden delicious apple all combining in the nose there s a fast high flow of creaminess that spreads quickly and disappears leaving a slightly fruity grainy aftertaste interesting sensations and again quite clean aromas are soft and creamy with a waft of sweet corn - underlain with a fairly blunt alcohol burn that comes through more as you smell it quite sweet on the palate a wash of green corn but the flavor isn t enough to tangle successfully with the fuel which leads to a tongue-curlingly hot finish some definite potential but it really needs time in a big oak barrel or some ice and a bottle of dr pepper an oddball whiskey by all accounts with a very high 722% of wheat in the mashbill distillation on an old farmhouse cognac still and aging in a little oregon barn in 63-gallon new oak barrels the result is a strange disjointed whiskey that starts out pillow-soft with wheat and caramel and then dramatically shifts to raw oak nougat and cinnamon stick the flavors in billy don t integrate well theyre like a jazz band severely out of step made from 100% rye but aged in wine casks distinctly pink tinge rosã© whiskey very young nose rye grain starburst candies and feinty vegetable notes along with the wine-oak thin dry reminiscent of a dry hay barn dusty grain warm wood planks a bit medicinal aged 130 days and tastes like it growing up in pennsylvania highspire was a town we stayed out of good advice a lively light fruitiness white grapes green plum in the nose quite grainy but with an interesting hint of vanilla and a slight saltiness finish is a bit astringent unlike the other koval spirits i m finding these an interesting exercise in distillation and educational so that s what wheat smells like not much the aromas here seem to be mostly yeast-derived with a faint ripe fruitiness undefined peach apple? and alcohol heat and a touch of wheat-origin sweet grass wheat s in the mouth like chewing fresh grain with some water and alcohol it s all there and the finish is sweet and it s clean butâ¦that s about all white bread whiskey nose is sweet corn with some mintiness to it and some herbal notes hot but not off-putting tastes are not as sweet as expected a bit flat though the sweet corn does come through toward the end again though this one is quite hot which is not surprising the hudson baby bourbons - which this is the foundation for - have struck me as hot also price is per 375 ml nasty smell of chicken coop dried guano some ammonia and dust with grain underneath happily it tastes quite a bit better sweet grain snap of rye spice some dry cocoa powder but theres still a dustiness to it and a distinct small-barrel woodiness hard to get past that aroma seems like theres more than one problem here showing its youth through an obvious green character that peers from beneath a cloak of campfire and applewood smoke with banana as the prominent fruit along with secondary apple citrus and a peculiar rubber tire note the palate is light-bodied and overtly sweet with grass marshmallow and vanilla reminiscent of a lowland malt which only contributes to the disjointed feeling of the whole package very similar to the midwest wheat in aroma with a slight additional tanginessébut that could be from sensory deprivation drier in the mouth with a slight medicinal character to it that increases as the finish goes on like a high school chemistry lab storeroom or a bottle of fresh aspirin made from 100% rye and usda certified organic very hot for 40% herbal nose very green with rye much smoother on the palate and very quick thereõs a fast shot of rye mint up front some grassiness and a sharp flick of heatéand then it vanishes leaving only a fading flinty-sweet afternote clean but not a lot of substance the nose on this whiskey is like smelling a wet empty barrel its all oak char and cinnamon spice the entry is thin watery and understated with light caramel and cinnamon in the mid-palate the oak tannins completely take over its not just oak spice but the puckeringly dry sour and bitter tannins this all leads to a bitter bone dry finish good whiskey is a conversation between spirit and wood but here the wood is doing all the talking many moonshine products are centered around corn but freedom moonshine mixes it up with a mashbill of 95% rye and 5% malted barley yeasty rye bread defines the nose with an undercurrent of white grape the entry is soft with yeasty rye vanilla and bran flakes thereõs some structure in the mid-palate with rye spice and black pepper but it needs more the finish is a little flat all pointing to the need for a slightly higher proof aged for òat leastó one month this bourbon is a collaboration with the band fierce dead rabbit better days is pale gold and noticeably cloudy on the nose itõs paste yeasty bread dough and wet pavement on the palate it is all over the place with raw oak cinnamon almond and black pepper theres no balance and no integration the finish is short hot and dry as whiskey ages it goes through odd awkward phases and thats where this one is there are flavoredñcinnamon and coconutñversions at lower proof this is the òoriginaló unflavored at full proof unaged and clear the aroma is clean and full of roasted corn and a ripple of deep caramel surprisingly appealing actually tastes like raw new make though green feinty vegetal and crying out for cola ginger ale even mountain dew to help mask it are we done with ômoonshineõ yet? please? the nose starts with sweet corn cornmeal yeasty bread and black pepper with wet dog and a slight varnishy note right behind the entry is soft and round with dry cornmeal bran flakes and yeasty bread unfortunately the varnish note from the nose returns pretty clearly in the mid-palate along with black pepper everything wraps up with a shorter than expected finish the heart of this whiskey is interesting but it could benefit from a much tighter cut distillery store only clear slight golden hue as expected from a 7% straight whiskey93% grain neutral spirit òspirit whiskeyó faint nose of sweet caramel corn in a hot bloom of estery alcohol thickly sweet in the mouth with barely a hint of whiskey like a badly-made cocktail or an ill-conceived flavored vodka while there are no glaring flaws in the make this is simply a bad idea light whiskey failed once in the 1970s and for good reasons those reasons havent changed i love rogue beers as well as rogueõs attitude and philosophy but this whiskey just tastes too immatureñharsh sweet and one-dimensional maybe with some additional aging it might come around mellow out and develop but it has a long way to go an unaged whiskey from carroll county iowa with rye grain and sugar mash the nose is all kinds of barnyard funk hay horse and manure underneath is a bite of sugar and vanilla on the palate itõs less funky with sugar strawberry and a grappa-like note the rye spice emerges mid-palate but itõs fleeting and leads to an edgy and fractured finish time in oak might help but there are issues here that wood wonõt resolve\n",
